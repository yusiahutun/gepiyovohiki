The story highlights "the contrast between the world they want to appear to inhabit and the one they actually do" and refers to the pair as the "exiles on Pennsylvania Avenue." It also investigated Trump administration's family business model, which Ellison wrote "favors Kushner and Ivanka above all others."</p><p>Here are seven jaw-droppers from the Vanity Fair takedown of of the political power couple.</p><h2 class=h2>Jared and Ivanka don't have much faith in Trump's presidency.</h2><p>Ellison wrote that she has heard chatter in D.C. that the couple won't last. "Not because they are at risk of being pushed out, but because they will save themselves from a damaged White House," she wrote, and cited a well-connected strategist in New York who said the couple are considering a move at the end of the school year in 2018.</p><p>"When they decide it's more important to protect their own and their children's reputations than it is to defend their indefensible father's, that's a sign the end is near," one influential Republican donor told Ellison.</p><p>Ellison pointed out later in the piece that "neither has committed to staying the duration of the Trump presidency, which both must realize may well be cut short."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4a587553-7786-5b9d-825f-77d06403edc6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:e5c77ee9-f740-5e71-8c9a-4d7725330650 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/aa/5by4/2017/08/18/aa175557eb6352a88873f0b794a6d134_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Someone Actually Had 13 Surgeries to Look Like Ivanka Trump</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>They've lost friends and business associates for political gain.</h2><p>According to Ellison, "One former associate, who had brought up the ugly rhetoric of the campaign Kushner had helped run, that he did not 'give a shit' if the associate didn't want to do business with Kushner anymore."</p><p>A New York friend also said, "I haven't had anything to do with them since they moved and it is because the day that man gave an inaugural speech, what am I going to say? 'What the f-ck is wrong with you?'"</p><h2 class=h2>Ivanka claims she 'didn't ask for' this spotlight -- but she actually did.</h2><p>Ellison called B.S. on Ivanka's infamous “I didn't ask for this” line during a TV interview. The article argues Ivanka “served as a surrogate throughout the campaign” and Jared was “deeply involved in managing it.”</p><p>Instead, Ellison argued that what they really didn't ask for is “the actual situation in which they find themselves: powerful, in a sense, and yet ineffectual; emotionally essential to Donald Trump, but lacking the skills to assist; impossible to fire and reluctant to leave; compromised ethically and perhaps legally; and facing reputational or familial harm no matter what they decide to do."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:316536fa-ce31-5316-a4bd-d318cfe9916e data-container-ref=toofab:article:e5c77ee9-f740-5e71-8c9a-4d7725330650 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ff/5by4/2017/08/25/ff9a2341d2a75171b36563b2bcf28985_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Twitter Mocks Ivanka Trump for Sharing Pictures of Her Fan Mail</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>They're even bad dinner-party guests.</h2><p>Ellison's investigation also lead to another conclusion: Kushner and Ivanka are also bad dinner-party guests. She referenced an “off-the-record dinner at the home of Atlantic Media's owner, David Bradley,” adding that it was “the sort of soirée Bradley holds on a regular basis with newsmakers and prominent Washington reporters and columnists.”</p><p>One nameless attendee told Ellison that the couple was “terrible” and that they “kept to platitudes and pabulum, as they often do in public conversations.” Sources close to the couple told Ellison that Kushner and Ivanka's days in Washington are numbered, so much so that they don't care to “put down roots” in any social capacity.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:36937f99-bb58-5471-8f5e-442c661a6b89 data-container-ref=toofab:article:e5c77ee9-f740-5e71-8c9a-4d7725330650 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/14/5by4/2017/08/28/1435baeb8fda5cc18ffbb20d4b401fe3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">MTV Plays 'F-ck Donald Trump' During VMAs Commercial Break</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>They have no actual say in what happens at the White House.</h2><p>Ellison called Ivanka "a 35-year-old former real-estate and retail executive in over her head," because her main value in Washington is access to her father, but she seems unable to sway him on any of the issues she claims she's focusing on.</p><p>"Trump is emotionally dependent on his son-in-law and his daughter...but they can't do anything for him," a Washington veteran told Ellison. "All they can do is make him feel better about what his life has come to."</p><h2 class=h2>They have zero self-awareness.</h2><p>"What is off-putting about them is they do not grasp their essential irrelevance," a veteran Washington, D.C., player told Ellison. "They think they are special."</p><h2 class=h2>They're not very nice to staff.</h2><p>"[Ivanka] tries to charm you at first, and then there'll be the cutting remark in front of her father,” a former adviser told Ellison.</p><p>As for Kushner, Ellison wrote, “He tries to be casual and jokes with other staffers, can have even more of an edge. Once, when Priebus asked Kushner what his team of Cordish and Liddell had been up to, Kushner retorted, according to someone who heard the exchange, 'Reince, we aren't getting paid. What the f-ck do you care?'"</p><p>Ellison argued the couple "have complicitly engaged in Trump's humiliation of various staffers, be it West Wing aides, Bannon, Priebus, and Kellyanne Conway, or Cabinet members such as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Attorney General Jeff Sessions."</p><p>Ellison also cited "several people who heard the comments" that Kushner repeatedly told Trump that Priebus, who was ousted from the administration earlier this summer, was "weak."</p><p><strong>Read the full report on Ivanka and Jared on <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>.</strong></p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b5/o/2017/01/20/b57aa86ea775596c8f39c46406993ef3_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnh7j3Fma3FfZn5utsCwZJ2qn6W9pr7SZp2rp51iw6K6yK2wZp6Rnr%2B0edKcmK2gmaO0brXVmqWkmV2pv7a5z2aYp5xdn66zscNmoq6rmKOys3nTmqKenJ%2Bsu3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
