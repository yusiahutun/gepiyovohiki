'I was moving furniture in January last year and vaguely remember something going “pop”. It wasn't excruciating, just a niggle, but as time went on, the irritating discomfort turned into a searing pain.<br></span></p><p><span>'I carried on going to the gym and worked through the pain, but as it turns out, the specific exercises&nbsp; I was doing were the very ones I should have been avoiding: pull-downs behind the head, bench presses lower than a 90-degree angle, and tricep dips.<br></span></p><p><span>'All of these exercises make the shoulder joint very vulnerable, and if you haven't got a problem already, there is a high risk those exercises will give you one.'</span></p><p><span>In March, Urs was in Las Vegas where his girlfriend Kelly Phelan, a professional gymnast who performs with Cirque du Soleil, is based.<br></span></p><p><span>Surrounded by athlete friends who have experienced similar injuries, he was encouraged to see Dr James Dettling, a renowned orthopaedic surgeon. He discovered two separate injuries: the first was a tear between the place that the bicep arm muscle attaches to the labrum, a band of tough tissue that surrounds the entire socket of the shoulder joint holding it in place (also known as a SLAP tear), and another to the rotator cuff, the muscles and tendons that also surround the shoulder, controlling and stabilising movement. Dr Dettling says:&nbsp; 'I see a lot of sports people with these injuries. But anybody of any age can sustain it if they happen to fall badly on their arm or shoulder.'</span></p><span><b><span>'Working out is such a huge part of my life. Having that routine and purpose taken away has been psychologically hard. But seeing and feeling my body change<span> </span>has been even harder'</span></b></span><p><span>While SLAP tears generally happen due to wear and tear, rotator cuff injury typically happens due to a sudden trauma. Unlike Urs, most people normally know when and how they've done it. 'It's a pretty dramatic injury,' says Dr Dettling.</span></p><p><span>Eventually, Urs found it was affecting everything he did. 'It got to the point where any movement of my arm above a right angle to my body was impossible. I couldn't even pick up my daughter,' he says. 'If I tried to swim, next day my arm would feel as if it was falling off.'</span></p><p><span>So with Dr Dettling at the helm, in August last year Urs underwent a reconstructive operation to repair these two areas of the shoulder.</span></p><p><span>These procedures used to be carried out - and still are by some surgeons - through a large incision&nbsp; but now the procedure can be done via tiny keyhole 'stabs', or so-called arthroscopic surgery.<br></span></p><p><span>Urs's operation took a little more than an hour under general anaesthetic and was done through two small incisions. Dr Dettling says: 'The tissue that anchors the bicep tendon to the labrum was torn, so we had to tie it back up to where it's supposed to be. We do this by drilling a hole in the bone and inserting an anchor attached suture wire, which will stay in place for ever.'</span></p><p><span>With his arm in a sling for two weeks, Urs assumed that once it was taken off, he could start getting back to normal. 'Everyone kept telling me it would take three months to recover, but I didn't believe it. I naively thought that once the sling was off I could start doing normal things again.<br></span></p><p><span>'But as soon as I took my arm out, it just fell limply beside my body. I wasn't able to do anything with&nbsp; it and I was pretty freaked out. I couldn't even wash my own hair.'</span></p><p><span>Dr Dettling put Urs on an intense training programme, three times a week for ten weeks, to increase range of movement, and strengthen the shoulder.<br></span></p><img id=i-91cf0e1a src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/08/article-2554679-1B4C769F00000578-8_306x360.jpg height=360 width=306 alt="Urs Buhler and girlfriend Kelly Phelan" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Urs Buhler and girlfriend Kelly Phelan</p><p><span>Urs says: 'I became very impatient. I'd gone from being such an active person to sitting in an apartment waiting for my next physio appointment. I couldn't even ride my motorbike because I wasn't allowed to hold the handlebars.'</span></p><p><span>But gradually, his range of movement improved and he was allowed to do gentle exercises using small weights. 'I'd lie down on my hotel room floor and do simple things such as lifting an umbrella,' he says. 'Since the surgery I've also been doing more core exercises. I've pretty much got full movement back, though it's still painful to lift my arm above my head.'</span></p><p><span>Adrian Wilson, an orthopaedic surgeon at the North Hampshire Hospital, says these injuries are often seen in rugby players or American footballers. So why would something so minor as moving furniture be to blame in this case? He suggests there could have been an older injury that caused a weakness that led to a minor incident, such as hauling coffee tables around, causing the rupture - which was then exacerbated by exercise.<br></span></p><p><span>But he adds: 'There's nothing to suggest that once you've sustained an injury like this and had it reconstructed, you're at a higher risk of it happening again. These kinds of repair are very effective and, as long as you do the right physio afterwards and take it slowly, there's nothing to say you won't be back in the gym before long.'</span></p><p><b><span>lIl Divo's album of Broadway songs, A Musical Affair, is out now.</span></b></p><h3 class=wocc><b><span>THE REPAIR THAT TUNED UP URS'S WRECKED SHOULDER</span></b><br></h3><p><span>By Adrian Wilson, orthopaedic surgeon</span></p><ul><li><span>The shoulder is a ball-and-socket&nbsp; joint where the ball is the head of the upper arm bone (humerus) and the socket is the shallow bowl (glenoid)&nbsp; on the shoulder blade (scapula).</span></li><li><p>The socket is encircled by a tough band of tissue called the labrum.&nbsp; This acts to deepen the socket and stabilise the joint.</p></li><li><p>It is rather like a golf ball sitting&nbsp; on a golf tee.</p></li><li><p>The large muscle at the front of the arm is called the bicep, and it has a&nbsp; long tendon which fits into the labrum&nbsp; at the top of the socket, anchoring the two together.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>This is where a&nbsp; SLAP tear occurs.<br></p></li></ul><img id=i-ae380e98 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/08/article-2554679-1B4BF0BA00000578-369_634x805.jpg height=805 width=634 alt="During the repair operation, instruments are used to manipulate the torn tendon back into position" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>During the repair operation, instruments are used to manipulate the torn tendon back into position</p><ul><li><p>During the repair operation, instruments&nbsp; are used to manipulate&nbsp; the torn tendon back&nbsp; into position.<br></p></li><li><p>The insertion point is prepared with a small&nbsp; drill to make a fixing&nbsp; point.
