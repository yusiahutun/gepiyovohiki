She is a Spanish model, dancer, and mother to the footballer’s daughter. Not much is known about the model (especially before she met the talented striker) probably because she seems to love her privacy. This explains why it was quite some time before most fans realized that there was something between Georgina Rodriguez and Cristiano Ronaldo. In fact, it was after her attendance at several football events and award ceremonies like the Best FIFA Football Awards that fans understood that she had become a crucial member of the Ronaldo family.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/813cb7d229e05335.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Roger Waters: 78-Year-Old Singer Marries His 43-Year-Old Former Driver</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/813cb7d229e05335.jpg><p class=align-left>While it may not be easy to determine when exactly they began dating, the couple’s first public appearance was in mid-November. From there, the relationship seemed to have advanced, and paparazzi kept snapping the couple together in public towards the end of 2017. Most memorably, the football star was spotted in a wig and dark sunglasses as he tried to disguise himself on his trip with his girlfriend to Disneyland Paris.</p><p class=align-left>The model has since attended his matches and has been spotted at several games in Santiago Bernabeu stadium and Allianz Stadium (Real Madrid and Juventus’ stadiums respectively) in the executive boxes sitting beside her son.
