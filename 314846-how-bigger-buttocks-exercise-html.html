Mind your diet</h3><p class=align-left>You may have heard it said that you are what you eat. Therefore, any method that will increase your hips and buttocks naturally has to consider your meals. Getting a bigger butt is more about what you do in the kitchen than in the gym.</p><p class=align-left>A balanced <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">diet</a> full of organic foodsis one of the most effective strategies for getting a bigger butt. The muscles in the body develop because they are well-nourished. You should kick out deep-fried junk food and check on your portions and the timing of meals.</p><p class=align-left>Your meal plan should contain foods that increase and build your buttock muscles without adding unnecessary fat to other parts of your body. A healthy diet geared towards a bigger butt should include the following:</p><ul><li>Dry fruits: These include dates, raisins, prunes and coconuts, and avocado, among others. They contain healthy fats and calories, which can help build an enormous behind. Fruits also have numerous health benefits, like helping to build immunity.</li><li>Peanut butter: <a href=#>Peanut butter</a> contains high amounts of fats and proteins, which can help to increase your weight around the booty. It has added health benefits like reducing the risk of certain cancers of the gut. Nuts are also a recommended addition to your diet and are a healthy snack option as they contain healthy fats.</li><li>Cottage cheese: This is a must-try for women who want to get bigger buttocks fast at home. The cheese is rich in protein and fat-burning properties and can enhance the glutes immensely.</li><li>Sweet potatoes: Sweet tubers are a healthy alternative to wheat, and they also contain phytoestrogen, the plant equivalent of estrogen, the female hormone. Estrogen plays the role of deposition of fat in the butt of the women, so adding sweet potatoes to your meals can help you get a bigger butt without exercise.</li><li>Mayonnaise: Mayonnaise is rich in oil and egg yolk and has a lot of fat. When consumed, it adds extra fat to your booty. Mayonnaise helps to nourish the butt muscles. However, consume mayonnaise in moderation; otherwise, it is likely to cause massive weight gain. Do light workouts to shape and sculpt the fat gained as well.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs3hiiib2bsktg.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best bodybuilding foods to gain muscle</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4244aa89211a6ccb.jpg><h3 id=314846-2-vaseline-and-toothpaste-for-bigger-buttocks class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>2.
