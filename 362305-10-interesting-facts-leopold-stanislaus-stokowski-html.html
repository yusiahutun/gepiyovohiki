Stan has outgrown his American descent to become an international entrepreneurial icon.</p><h2>Interesting facts about Leopold Stanislaus "Stan" Stokowski</h2><p class=align-left>Stan shares an exciting life story surrounded by an endless stream of breakthroughs and fallbacks. It is hard to start admiring what a successful entrepreneur he has become without unearthing these notable facts.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Gloria Vanderbilt net worth in 2020</p><h3>1.

Gloria fought for the custody of her children after divorcing Stokowski in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">1955.</a></p><p class=align-left>Gloria Vanderbilt and Leopold Stanislaus Stokowski shared a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">strong mother-son</a> bond. Stanislaus remained close to his mother until her death in mid-2019. In as much as he prefers to keep his personal life locked away from public scrutiny, Stan was occasionally seen in public in the company of his mother. A touching<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> tribute series</a> "The Rainbow Comes and Goes; A Mother and Son on Life, Love, and Loss (2016)" by his mother and brother Anderson is proof enough that the two brothers shared a good mother-son relationship with Gloria.</p><h3>2. He is the son of a man who shaped modern orchestras</h3><p class=align-left>Modern-day orchestras may not have been the same without the contributions of Leopold Stanislaus Stokowski's father, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Leopold Anthony Stokowski</a>. Leopold Stanislaus Stokowski grandparents on his father's side were Kopernick Stokowski and Annie-Marion Moore. Anthony's founding role and directions at the Philadelphia Orchestra are still memorable. He stood out from his English descent to influence the world with the role of a conductor.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/58bb89d101c509e6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>David Sankok, 6 Other Kenyan Politicians Who Have Lost Their Children</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Various contributions coined by Stokowski are timeless and continue to outlive him with a flashy reputation. Stokowski featured in several notable productions, among them Walt Disney's animated film Fantasia. His career afforded several inputs for the progress of art during his time.</p><h3>3. Stan is handsome, tall and from the white Caucasian ethnicity</h3><p class=align-left>Stanislaus is a good-looking American with green eyes and white hair. He measures 5 feet and 8 inches in height (173 cm). Stan weighs approximately 68 Kg (150 lbs) and shares relaxed expressions like those of his mother, Gloria. His boldness is a strength that qualifies him as a competent entrepreneur.</p><h3>4. Leopold is not close to his brothers</h3><p class=align-left>What happened to Christopher Stokowski? Stan is rarely in the company of his siblings. Not much detail is available about his relationship with brothers, including Anderson Cooper. We, however, know that he hardly sees Christopher, his younger brother, who <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">distanced himself</a> from the family in 1978.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0266d7d59adb6c99.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Genius Boy who Built Replica of Overhead Bridge Gets US Scholarship, His Mum Gets KSh 275k, Dad a Job</span></p></a><h3>5. Stanislaus is happily married</h3><p class=align-left>Does Gloria Vanderbilt have grandchildren? Stokowski Jr is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">happy family man </a>with his wife, Emily Goldstein, and two daughters. Leopold Stanislaus Stokowski children, Gloria's grandchildren, are called Aurora (married to New York-based investor, Anthony Mazzei) and Abra. His brother, Anderson, is openly gay and has a newborn son, Wyatt Morgan Cooper.</p><h3>6. Stanislaus has two step fathers</h3><p class=align-left>Gloria sired Stanislaus in his second marriage with Leopold Anthony Stokowski. The first marriage was to the talent agent, Pasquale De Cicco, but they divorced in 1945. After the divorce between Stan's parents, Gloria proceeded to marry director Sidney Lumet within months after parting ways with Antony. Gloria left the marriage in late 1963 without his child.</p><p class=align-left>She later met and married Wyatt Emory Cooper the same year and lived with him until he died in 1978. Gloria maintained his romantic life with several other lovers, among them Howard Hughes, Frank Sinatra, Roald Dahl, and Marlon Brando.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7067527ddde1e676.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Chris Isaak's wife?

Stokowski Jr is a maternal half-brother to Anderson cooper</h3><p class=align-left>Leopold Stanislaus Stokowski and Christopher Stokowski (born in 1952), sons of Gloria and Anthony, are maternal half-brothers to Anderson Cooper. Anderson is, however, a biological brother to Carter Vanderbilt Cooper, who committed suicide at age 23 by jumping to his death from a 14-story building. Anderson and Carter's dad was Wyatt Emory Cooper.</p><h3>8. Stanislaus is 17 years older than Anderson Cooper</h3><p class=align-left>Stan is the eldest child of Gloria. His youngest stepbrother, Anderson Cooper, was born later in 1967. Their 17 years age difference is, however, not so noticeable from their appearances.</p><h3>9. Stanislaus is a wealthy man</h3><p class=align-left>Who is the heir to the Vanderbilt fortune? Stanislaus and his younger brother, Anderson, inherited a great deal of wealth from their fallen mother. Sources reveal that their estranged brother Christopher <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">banked nothing </a>from Gloria's costly estates. Leopold Stanislaus Stokowski <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">inheritance included</a> a Manhattan-based Co-op at 30 Beekman Place. Although his exact net worth is not disclosed, it is believed to be an 8 figure amount.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e7efd182e94b2ff3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Are Mutt Lange and Marie-Anne still together?

Vanderbilt did not include Chris in the will, which the beneficiaries escalated at the Manhattan Surrogate Court. The fact that Christopher Stokowski was away from her mother for more than 40 years may have contributed to his exclusion.</p><h3>10. His mother was involved in a high profile child custody trial of the 1930s</h3><p class=align-left>The fact that history repeats itself is apparent in the life of Leopold Stanislaus Stokowski. His mother, Gloria, would grow to fight for the custody of her children after divorcing his second husband, Leopold Anthony Stokowski, in 1955. Back in the 1930's, when Gloria was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">10 years of age</a>, her mother (also called Gloria) and paternal aunt, Gertrude Whitney, fought for her custody. Gloria's mom was said to have neglected her, was greedy, and immoral.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>CNN's Ana Cabrera bio age, ethnicity, husband, salary and net worth</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0b787b518de9b983.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How Chelsea could line up vs Everton without 2 key players</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Leopold Stanislaus Stokowski is a compelling character with fearless expressions.
