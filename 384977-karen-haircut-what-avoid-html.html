One of those hairstyles is Karen haircut, which has become popular in most parts of the US. It largely depicts a sense of entitlement among middle-aged white ladies.</p><p class=align-left>What is the story behind the Karen haircut name, though? Nowadays, “Karens” are all over, and not so many people would love to be associated with them. They are hated due to their traits, but they hardly express regrets for their actions. They can go to any length to degrade others because they believe the world exists according to their standards.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7e95f383b5a00693.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best quotes from To Kill a Mockingbird that will blow your mind</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Well, you may want to learn more about the haircut and why you need to avoid it at all costs.</p><h2>What is Karen haircut?</h2><p class=align-left>It is simply a short, angled, and layered hairstyle mostly worn by white ladies – inverted bob or lob. It is usually longer in the front and shorter in the back. Though, the style cannot be complete without the chunky highlights.</p><p class=align-left>Initially, it was blonde only. However, with time, the style has evolved – it now includes many colours. Also, others do a combination of colours.</p><p class=align-left>Over time, some people have invented new names for the haircut. For instance, they can also refer to it as “Mom hair” or “Can I speak to your manager?” Well, the history behind these names may baffle you.</p><h3>The origin of the haircut</h3><p class=align-left>The exact origin of the hairstyle is yet to be pinned down due to the many theories behind its invention. Some of them are as follows:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4d89567e78ab0719.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of top 10 most toxic fandoms in the world as of 2022</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7e95f383b5a00693.jpeg><p class=align-left>A section of people believes it became rampant when Kate Gosselin of <i>Jon & Kate Plus 8</i> reality TV show wore it.

To some, these types of people have been around in almost all centuries. The only change is that they have become worse recently, especially due to increased cases of racism.</p><h3>How to fix the haircut</h3><p class=align-left>Remember, you have the freedom to do whatever you wish with your hair. Thus, learning how to fix a Karen haircut is not a bad thing to do. Most stylists insist that the hair should be short in the back and long in the front. Most ladies like it when the bangs in the front go down to the chin.</p><p class=align-left>Blonde is the most common one but you can also do many colours. The styling of the highlights is also another factor you may want to consider.</p><p class=align-left>Some of the available ultimate Karen haircut styles to try are Overly Piecey Locks, Overly Styled Layers, Teased Layers, Blown Back Lob, Asymmetric Pixie Cut, Heavy Bang Pixie, Bubble Haircuts, Ribbon-Like Curls, Side-Swept Pixie, and Spikey Pixie, among many others.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6109147c5cb8a58e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ugandan man finally marries American woman he met on dating app</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> How to curl weave with flexi rods</p><p class=align-left>The male Karen haircut version is also emerging, but it is not rampant as the female one. Often, it is used in memes to depict men who have the same personality as that of Karen.</p><h3>Why should you avoid it?</h3><p class=align-left>Primarily, the reason why the majority of people hate the haircut is because of the negative tags associated with it. It depicts women who ride on their privileges as a weapon of demeaning others.</p><p class=align-left>Usually, such women will not hesitate to call police on someone. Their malicious motives define their personality. They hardly feel remorseful about their actions. Obviously, they are hated by many because of their entitlement.</p><p class=align-left>Would you want to be identified as one? Undoubtedly, that is the last thing you want. We all want others to have a good impression of us. So, why risk it all? But again, there are high chances you will find someone of a good character wearing the hairstyle.
