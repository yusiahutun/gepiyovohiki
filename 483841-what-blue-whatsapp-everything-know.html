The application has many features that are not available in the original WhatsApp. For example, you can change the app’s background wallpaper, icon, theme, and chat screen. Furthermore, the application lets you hide specific functions from your users to give you some privacy.</p><h2>What are the features of Blue WhatsApp?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c5da179fe18416f6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is JTWhatsapp and is it safe to download? All the details</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Whether Blue WhatsApp GB or Blue WhatsApp for <a href=#>business</a>, the app has many features that can improve your instant messaging experience. Here are some of the features:</p><h3>Preview images</h3><p class=align-left>When using the original WhatsApp, once you receive an image and download it, you will find it in your gallery. With Blue WhatsApp, you can preview images before saving them to your file explorer. That is an advantage because it can prevent you from saving unnecessary files on your phone.</p><h3>Add polls in groups</h3><p class=align-left>One of the biggest drawbacks of WhatsApp is that you cannot add or create polls in groups. That option is now available in Blue WhatsApp. You can add any poll and get results instantly.</p><h3>Repost status</h3><p class=align-left>You can read a contact’s status on WhatsApp. However, you cannot repost it. It allows you to read your status and repost it on your status.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/132497ab27bd7adb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>FMWhatsApp features and safety: Is it similar to GBWhatsApp?</span></p></a><h3>Blue WhatsApp privacy options</h3><p class=align-left>Blue WhatsApp has more privacy options than the original WhatsApp. For example, you can determine who can call you, hide the second grey tick, hide the blue tick, and hide your <a href=#>online status</a>. Also, you can freeze the Last Seen feature, but you must restart your phone to make the changes.</p><h3>Disable forwarded</h3><p class=align-left>The recipient will see the forwarded tag when you forward a message on WhatsApp. That means the message did not come from the sender. It allows you to resend messages without the forwarded tag.</p><h3>Customise Blue WhatsApp to iPhone style</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c5da179fe18416f6.jpg><p class=align-left>You can change several features in in the app to look like the iPhone’s. For example, you can change the emoji in the app to be like iPhone emojis. Also, you can change the upper bar to look like an<a href=#> iPhone theme</a>. The setting is to go to the Home screen – Header, then select your iOS style.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/547022ddf504b350.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is GB WhatsApp safe? Here's everything you need to know</span></p></a><h3>Customise conversations</h3><p class=align-left>Blue WhatsApp allows you to customise conversations in different ways. For example, you can increase the message text size or choose your ticks style. Also, you can change your bubble chat style, the background colour of your conversation, and the right chat bubble colour and text.</p><h3>Use two accounts on the same phone</h3><p class=align-left>If you have WhatsApp only, you cannot use two numbers at the same time. However, Blue WhatsApp business allows you to use two accounts simultaneously. In other words, you can use the original WhatsApp along with Blue WhatsApp without losing your number.</p><h3>Easy to make phone calls</h3><p class=align-left>Blue WhatsApp allows you to make a phone call without saving a number. Furthermore, you can disable voice calls on the app to prevent people from calling you. But even if you disable voice calls, you can still make video calls. Apart from calls, you can send voice notes on Blue WhatsApp.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/547022ddf504b350.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best status-saver app to save WhatsApp status on Android or iOS</span></p></a><h3>Save offline messages</h3><p class=align-left>Blue WhatsApp lets you save <a href=#>offline messages </a>on its server. The app will resend the messages once you have a stable internet connection.</p><h2>How to download and install Blue WhatsApp</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/132497ab27bd7adb.jpeg><p class=align-left>This app is not available on the Google Play Store. Therefore, you must find its .apk file online, download it, and install it on your device. However, since you will install it from an unknown source, you must enable the setting to proceed with the installation. Here is what you should do:</p><ul><li>Go to Settings.</li><li>Select Apps & Notifications.</li><li>Choose Special App access.</li><li>Select Install unknown apps.</li><li>Tap on your browser and file manager.</li><li>Enable the option labelled Allow from this source.</li><li>After enabling an unknown source, you can proceed to install the app.</li></ul><h2>Can you download Blue WhatsApp for iPhone?</h2><p class=align-left>You cannot download Blue WhatsApp Plus for iPhone. That is because Apple’s iOS has many <a href=#>security</a> features that prevent the installation of apps from unknown sources. So since it is unavailable for iOS, you cannot install it on your iPhone.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8ce95f89fffee5be.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to put multiple pictures on an Instagram story in a few steps</span></p></a><h2>Which is the best between original WhatsApp and Blue WhatsApp?</h2><p class=align-left>In terms of features, Blue WhatsApp is better than the original WhatsApp. Also, the former has many privacy and customisation options that are unavailable in the latter.</p><h2>Is it illegal to use Blue WhatsApp?</h2><p class=align-left>Technically, Blue WhatsApp is illegal because it copied the source code of WhatsApp. However, it is not unlawful to use it.</p><h2>What are the dangers of using Blue WhatsApp?</h2><p class=align-left>The app is a mod that has modified the original WhatsApp source code. That can cause many risks, including the privacy and usage of your data. Also, it is easy to modify an existing app and add malware or spyware.</p><p class=align-left>Since the app does not have a privacy policy, you cannot tell how the application uses the data it collects from the app, including cookies and personal information. Therefore, while Blue WhatsApp has many excellent features, using it has hidden risks.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a75a18b7e1b0bc49.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best chat app in India: Top 10 chatting apps for Android and iOS in 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Blue WhatsApp is a modified app of the original WhatsApp. However, the difference with WhatsApp is that it is 100% blue.
