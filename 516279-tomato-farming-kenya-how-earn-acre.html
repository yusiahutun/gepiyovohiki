But how do you ascertain that your tomato farming makes commercial sense?</p><h2>How to start tomato farming in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>The commercial benefits of open-field tomato farming in Kenya or in a greenhouse boil down to how. Of course, like every other crop, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tomato farming </a>requires the right climatic conditions to grow. Combine this with the right <a href=#>business</a> acumen, and you’ll smile to the bank. But first, the fundamentals.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/20b82023e64c2b88.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Austria farmers up in arms over Brussels GMO plans</span></p></a><h3>Ecological requirements</h3><p class=align-left>Tomato thrives best in low-medium rainfall with supplementary irrigation during periods of drought. But you don’t want it to be too wet as wet conditions increase disease incidences and affect ripening.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, as you figure out where to plant, you must remember that water proximity is integral to avoiding additional water pumping costs. The cost would eventually reduce your returns from the venture.</p><p class=align-left>Another integral thing to remember is the previous crop. It would be best if you didn't plant tomato immediately after potatoes or pepper; you must observe a three-month break. Sticking to this practice to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mitigate against pests</a> and diseases.</p><h3>Purchase high-yield tomato species</h3><p class=align-left>Even if you are doing small-scale tomato farming, you must settle on a high-yield variant. After all, you want a bumper harvest. The market has numerous varieties, suitable for different climatic conditions, resistant to certain pests and diseases, and much more. Hence, you must consider all these factors to reap the most significant returns from your farm.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/79f65861462fb622.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ugliest animal in the world: 20 species and where to find them</span></p></a><h3>Planting and nursery preparation</h3><p class=align-left>You must adhere to the standard nursery preparation practices as this is where your planting begins, so you want to ensure everything runs smoothly. It can be lights out here if you play your cards wrong.</p><p class=align-left>Prepare the nursery by raising the soil around 15cm high and leaving spaces for walkways around 30cm or more between beds. Ascertain that the soil has fine particles. Watering at the nursery is best done in the morning and evening, and seeds are expected to sprout in around eight days.</p><h3>Transplanting</h3><p class=align-left>Do transplanting using a garden trowel. You can also apply other modern tomato farming techniques you know to make the process as straightforward as possible. It is better to ascertain that the roots carry a sufficient bag of soil while moving to the field for planting.</p><h3>Other essential practices</h3><p class=align-left>Once you have transplanted your seedlings, it is time to start caring for them to grow healthy and mature. This involves regular irrigation, fertiliser application, weeding and pest control. Ensure that you apply the right fertiliser at the right time and amount.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9a2e599e5a1430b1.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 plain lines hairstyles without braids for natural hair</span></p></a><p class=align-left>CAN (Calcium Ammonium Nitrate) is integral for lead development and should be applied immediately after transplanting. Apply urea for two to three weeks or CAN after five weeks. Once the flowering starts, top dress with NKP, and you can repeat this after the first harvest.</p><h3>Harvest</h3><p class=align-left>Tomatoes should be ready for harvesting from the 70th day onwards, reliant on the variety planted. Of course, if you followed through and applied the appropriate pre-planting, planting and pre-harvest practices.</p><h2>How much can one earn from one acre of tomatoes in Kenya?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/20b82023e64c2b88.jpg><p class=align-left>Farmers Trend shows you can make around Ksh.1,000,000 in total revenue from tomato farming in Kenya.

Expect to spend around Ksh.15,000 to Ksh.30,000 per acre for fertiliser and between Ksh.5,000 to Ksh.25,000 per acre for pesticides.</p><h3>Labour cost</h3><p class=align-left>Labour is essential when farming, especially planting, weeding, and harvesting. Your labour cost can range between Ksh.10,000 to Ksh.40,000 per acre.</p><h3>Market price</h3><p class=align-left>Of course, market price fluctuates reliant on season, location, and quality. The average price of tomatoes ranges between Ksh.30 to Ksh.80 per kilogram.
