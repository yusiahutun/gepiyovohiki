The decade was certainly vulnerable to critics and haters shouting, "That's not real country!" but most would agree that compared to today, the pendulum&nbsp;swinging between Hank's music and the&nbsp;established pop-country mix had less space to travel. When someone says a modern song recalls '90s country music, they're saying it's more traditional and a more definitive brand of country music.</p><p>The "real country music" argument allows&nbsp;us to dismiss some really&nbsp;corny ideas, however. Even some of the hits haven't stood the test of time —&nbsp;the Boot's own list of the <a href=#>10 worst country songs</a> that were big hits includes four from the '90s — but we refuse to let go. Taste of Country's list of <a href=#>50 essential '90s country songs</a> includes quite a few gems and lumps of coal, all of which are remembered with equal enthusiasm. These are things people actually sang, out loud, on the radio:</p><p>"I want to drink from your loving cup."&nbsp;</p><p>"She thinks my tractor's sexy, it really turns her on."&nbsp;</p><p>"Now I lay me down to sleep and pray the Lord my soul to keep / If I die before I wake, feed Jake / He's been a good dog."</p><p>"Fix me up with a mannequin, just remember I like blondes / I’ll be the life of the party even when I’m dead and gone / Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die."</p><p>"I gotta thank mama for the cookin', Daddy for the whoopin' ... I thank the bank for the money and thank God for you" - from Sawyer Brown's "Thank God for You," a song that came with this really uncomfortable music video:</p><p>The thing is, we all know this to be true but don't outwardly say it. Need proof? Think about how&nbsp;'90s country music is presented today. <a href=#>Walker Hayes</a>' very modern new single "<a href=#>90s Country</a>" came with several days of<a href=#> fake album covers</a> to promote it. <a href=#>Jason Aldean</a>'s "1994" celebrated farmer tans, time machines and (the famously mulleted) <a href=#>Joe Diffie</a>. <a href=#>Dierks Bentley'</a>s faux '90s cover band&nbsp;Hot Country Knights is as much a comedy show as it is a concert.&nbsp;To the modern country fan, '90s country music is a punchline.</p><p>That's an unfair assessment of a decade that&nbsp;regularly found original ways to express love, loss and life's frustrations.&nbsp;"Strawberry Wine" by <a href=#>Deana Carter</a> is the definitive first love song. No one has done defiance better than <a href=#>Travis Tritt</a> and <a href=#>Toby Keith</a> did 20 years ago, except for maybe <a href=#>Waylon Jennings</a> 20 years before that. That John Anderson's "Seminole Wind" was a hit is mind-blowing, considering the right field nature of his statement and sound.</p><p>History books will show a rich decade of new ideas and novel presentations.</p><p>Pop culture will remember "Achy Breaky Heart."</p><p>Which has more influence?</p><p>In 20 years, the same thing will probably happen to today's country music.&nbsp;Now that we're several years removed from bro-country, it's fair to wonder if our kids will smile on early songs by <a href=#>Florida Georgia Line </a>and mid-career hits by&nbsp;<a href=#>Luke Bryan </a>and&nbsp;<a href=#>Jason Aldean</a> and <a href=#>Randy Houser</a>&nbsp;in the same way Generation X and Y, and Millennials smile on the music of Diffie, <a href=#>Neal McCoy</a> and (sorry, but it's true) <a href=#>Shania Twain</a>. They'll likely embrace the charm of another era's culture and mannerisms, but inspirations to make great music for their generation will come from contemporaries.</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Point: The Boot Argues Why the '90s Are Actually the Best</a><p><strong>50 Essential '90s Country Songs:</strong></p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>See 50 Essential '90s Country Songs</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmcmijYrCwwc2tqbJlnarAqq%2BMnKaupqSav7G7yKeraA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
