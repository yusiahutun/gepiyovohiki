He won 204 of his 220 amateur fights. Later, he turned pro.</p><p>As a professional boxer, he was partially successful, mainly due to his drug use. Between 1980 and 1985, he earned around $5.2 million.</p><p>In December 1980, he rejected an offer of $500,000 (because he wanted more money) to fight Sugar Ray Leonard for the WBC Welterweight Championship.</p><p>For the two Argüello fights, Aaron was paid $3.85 million. However, his manager at the time, Buddy LaRosa, received 50% of the money Pryor won for boxing. He even once said – “After Buddy took his half, the government took half.” Aaron also said – ”Then after that, my wife at the time had to have her half.”</p><p>Therefore, at the time of his death, former professional boxer Aaron Pryor had an estimated net worth of $1 million.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT</strong></p><p><a href=#>Jeff Charleston – Bio & Net Worth</a></p><p><a href=#>Thomas DeLauer – Wife & Biography</a></p><p><a href=#>Jeremy Lin – Bio</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVflq6zu81mp6uxn6d8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
