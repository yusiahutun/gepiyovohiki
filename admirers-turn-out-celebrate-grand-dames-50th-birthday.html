The former governor's yacht, previously named the Lady Maurine, was launched from the Kowloon Docks on July 30, 1953. Yesterday's party was held at the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club.
Although there was no birthday cake and candles, the boat's owner, Yu Wing-woon, made sure there was plenty of food and wine for the seven-hour gathering."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Yesterday's party was held at the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although there was no birthday cake and candles, the boat's owner, Yu Wing-woon, made sure there was plenty of food and wine for the seven-hour gathering.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With an original British admiralty flag still clinging to her side, the yacht, now renamed the Madame Maurene, sat proudly by the dock as guests took photographs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'I wanted to throw Maurene a birthday party and show people how beautiful she is,' said Mr Yu, who rescued the vessel from an ignominious end in the scrapyard. He paid $210,000 for her and $2 million on her restoration.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Posted near the yacht were news clippings and photographs of the Maurene with her illustrious passengers of the past five decades. They included Sir David Wilson, Sir Edward Youde, Sir Robert Black, and Lord Murray MacLehose.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'The 300 photos of the boat we have on the display boards have never been shown before. I don't think Hong Kong still has boats this old that are still running and continuing to make history,' Mr Yu said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pointing to a photograph of the Yacht Club fire in April, 2000, Mr Yu's daughter, Anicia, said: 'The Maurene could have been burned down during the fire if the Yacht Club's staff didn't tow her away.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the one-hour guided tour of the boat, Ms Yu explained that much of the restoration - from painting the rails to tying new rigging - had been done by the family.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other than a few air conditioners, toilets, a DVD player and a television, everything is faithful to the boat's appearance when it was launched.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'We tried to track down actual items that were used on it. For instance, the Morse code machine, bell, lights, dishes, mattresses, and even the refrigerator, are all original,' she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Lady Maurine traditionally carried new governors from Kai Tak to Central when they first arrived. They later used the boat for recreational trips. The yacht, which once entertained royalty including Queen Elizabeth and Princess Diana, now takes the Yu family fishing in summer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mr Yu hopes the yacht, which was built in Hunghom and named after the wife of then-governor Sir Alexander Grantham, can be used to raise money for charity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdkZ4B0g5homJ2lmaeys7%2BMrayrpl2kwrV5wp6jnpqilsGmecarmKecXZmurrHSZmxprJhir6q%2B06GbmrE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
