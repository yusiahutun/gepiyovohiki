They got to know each other during Hollywood Week and made their relationship official during a 2018 trip to Disneyland, but kept things under wraps until the season finale, when they were announced as the two finalists.</p><p>"It was one of those things where I didn't want it to affect anything, and I didn't want to exploit my feelings for her, because they're very, very real," Hutchinson explained to <a href=#>ET Online</a> at the time. "Once voting was over, I was like, 'Shoot, I want the world to know.'"</p><p>Poppe was eventually<a href=#> crowned Idol's champ </a>for that season, and in a social media post celebrating her win, she said that her relationship with Hutchinson was one of the most special experiences she'd gotten out of her time on the show.</p><p>"One of the best gifts it's given me is Caleb Hutchinson. This guy captured my heart from the start and showed me what love truly means," she <a href=#>wrote</a>.</p><p>Though it's not clear exactly when Poppe and Hutchinson broke up, <a href=#>Country Now</a> reports that Poppe alluded to a breakup&nbsp;— without naming names&nbsp;— in April, when she put out a song called "Screw You a Little Bit."</p><p>"It is a breakup song," she confirmed, but made it seem like it might not be about Hutchinson.</p><p>“This one is not about who everyone thinks it’s about. That relationship, I still have a place in my heart and I have nothing but love and respect on that side of things," Poppe said. "So this is NOT about that person. Because I don’t have negative things to say about that particular person. If you are out there and if you are wondering. There you go.”</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>14 'American Idol' Singers Who Secretly Hooked Up — Or Did They?</h2>At least two couples who met through <a href=#>American Idol</a> got married, while one more could be headed in that direction.
