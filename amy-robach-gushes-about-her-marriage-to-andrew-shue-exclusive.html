He even got down on one knee!” she told Closer at the WebMD Health Hero Awards Now on January 15 in New York City. “Now I have to come up with something [for him]!”</p><p>Though Amy says Andrew is the romantic in their relationship, she does her fair-share to keep their bond strong, too. “<span>I keep the&nbsp;</span><span>house clean,&nbsp;</span><span>get groceries&nbsp;</span><span>— things that&nbsp;</span><span>don’t seem&nbsp;</span><span>romantic, but&nbsp;</span><span>really are!” she told us. As for <a href=#>what’s really kept the couple together all these years</a>, Amy told Closer in another interview that their relationship success is due to “a lot of hard work.”</span></p><p>“I mean we had the foundation of extreme passion and respect for one another and then yes, life gets hard, and five kids and ex-spouses and jobs that take us in different directions. It’s trying, but we work hard at it,”&nbsp;she explained. “We’d gone to couples therapy. Oh my gosh. Several times at different points in our marriage and we’re not shy to say that that has been a huge part in our success as a couple that we work at it and we get help when we need it.”</p><p>Amy and Andrew seem like the best couple — we wish them many more years of happiness together!</p><p class=p1>For more on Amy and Andrew, pick up the latest issue of Closer Weekly, on newsstands now — and be sure to <a href=#>sign up for our newsletter</a> for more exclusive news!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46apLJloqSvoq%2FHZp6uq5iawG6twaisrWWYmr9uucCrqaKZl5p6tbuMmqWdqpWserS01J5knrCTocK0tdWeZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
