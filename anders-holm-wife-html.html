They might share the same name, but that is where the similarities end. While Holmvik is single and probably could never keep a lady in the Workaholics frat house, Holm is married to his wife, Emma Nesper. 
Fans might recognize Holm as Mindy Khaling's pastor boyfriend on The Mindy Project and Anne Hathaway's stay-at-home husband in The Intern.

The actor told <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Harper’s Bazar</a> that they officially met at summer camp at the age of 12, but it wasn’t until high school that Holm developed a crush on his spouse.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He shared that when they were in high school,&nbsp;they bumped into each other at&nbsp;cosmic bowling. In the semi-darkness, he noticed that she was wearing “these little white shorts,” and he was like, “she seems cool from here.”</p><p>After that, he stalked her for months and learned that was she was a respectable and super smart “human with a giant brain and not just a pair of white shorts.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>They started dating when&nbsp;they attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison together.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><strong>Anders Holm's wife, Emma Nesper Holm</strong> (Source:&nbsp;Emma Nesper Holm <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><p>Holm graduated with a History major while his spouse graduated in journalism. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After graduation, Holm moved to Los Angeles to make it in the world of TV, which was easier said than done.</p><p>He worked odd jobs initially, but with faithfulness and self-discipline, his hard work paid off.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Nesper joined Holm in Los Angeles as he started his comedy career. And while Holm came up with dirty jokes, Nesper made a career working for nonprofits, trying to combat poverty in the developing world.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>And somewhere in between, in 2011, the duo tied the knot.</p><p>According to the actor, who has been with his wife for over a decade, the key to their long-lasting relationship is their dedication to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">making their relationship work</a>.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She’s awesome. I mean, like, you only can make it work if the other person is willing to make it work, and I’m lucky enough to have somebody like that.</p><h2>Anders Holm on Starting a Family</h2><p>Naturally, the next step for the actor and his partner was to start a family, which they did when they had two kids.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple welcomed their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first baby</a> on December 19, 2013.

He and his spouse have kept their son’s identity totally private, so much so that the public is not even privy to his son’s name.</p><p>After that, Holm and Nesper had a second kid.&nbsp;</p><p>There isn’t much information about it, but in 2020, he shared with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a> that his 2-year-old son would be a “cool young man someday.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmembKzv4yhpqWlXay2p7GNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
