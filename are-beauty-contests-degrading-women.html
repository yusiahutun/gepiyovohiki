Sadly, those are empty words. Beauty pageants are just commercial entertainment. If they are so important, why do the contestants always have to wear swimsuits? This is because the audience, including millions of TV viewers, enjoy seeing beautiful women in sexy clothes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There may be a lot of talented women among the participants, but the pageants do not have a chance to reflect their true abilities. Their performance during the interviews rarely counts as hosts usually ask dumb questions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is the women with sex appeal who have the best chance of winning the crown. This devalues women's intellect and integrity. Although beauty pageant winners do some charity work, their main intention is to enter the entertainment field. I don't believe they help to drive home the message that ability outweighs appearance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Oliver Kwan, 17 Delia School of Canada</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I don't think that beauty pageants degrade women.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beauty pageants have come a long way since their early days. The women involved are no longer portrayed as just pretty faces. They are motivated with real goals. The current Miss America is enrolled in medical school, and the 2003 winner gained a place at Harvard University's Law School. If anything, this has improved the image of women who are now considered as capable as their male counterparts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">No one forces women to enter beauty pageants.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Why would someone do something degrading? Most participants believe the experience will empower them to achieve more and help the community.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Imagine the entire world thinking you are pretty and smart. Imagine winning a huge cash prize. That's what happens at a beauty pageant.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some people say that beauty pageants are degrading because the focus is on appearance. While this is true, beauty is not the deciding factor anymore. The 2003 Miss America winner isn't exactly gorgeous, but her list of achievements amazes me. There is something special about someone who has won more than US$80,000 through scholarships.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdkbIVyhZVomKudXZeyosHTsmScp56psrTA0mabnp%2BilrGqusZmrqillaM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
