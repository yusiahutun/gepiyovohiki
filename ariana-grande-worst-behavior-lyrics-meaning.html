And TBH, that’s not a far cry from how Ari and Dalton’s relationship started. The pair were first seen together in February 2020 when Ari was spotted <a href=#>kissing a mystery man</a> at a restaurant, with multiple sources claiming at the time that they were already seeing each other for “several months”—but their relationship remained unconfirmed until later that summer, when Ariana went IG official went her beau in June 2020.</p><p>But why all the secrecy?
