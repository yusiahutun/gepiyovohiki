After the Ellisville All-Stars erased an early three-run deficit to send the title game into extra innings, Tad Emfinger became the hero of the afternoon with a walk-off single to give the Laurel-Jones County All-Stars a 7-6 victory, claiming the ultimate prize as Dixie Youth 9U World Series champions."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Both teams cruised to the final round of the World Series in Texas, earning four wins apiece to separate themselves from the competition as the clear best overall pair in the tournament.</p><figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-default"><span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle=modal data-photo-target=.photo-6bb39318-2a5c-11ee-b0f3-3f7959718604 data-instance=#gallery-items-de7fe8f8-2a5a-11ee-83f6-f301baf49f66-photo-modal data-target=#photo-carousel-de7fe8f8-2a5a-11ee-83f6-f301baf49f66><span class="fas tnt-expand"></span></span> <span class=caption-text><p>LJC All-Stars Mason Welch and Tad Emfinger hug as their teammates rush to join the celebration after Emfinger’s walk-off hit in a 7-6 victory over Ellisville for the 9U World Series championship. <strong>(Photo by Amanda Blakeney)</strong></p></span><span class=clearfix></span></figure><p>“Those are two great teams that were well-coached, and they went at it all summer, so talk about a fitting way to end it,” Rheams added. “For both teams to have come this far is pretty remarkable.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcLLRnpxmq6SWwaZ50qqsmpyjYsGit8Rmmp6mpJq%2Fbr%2FTmp6eZ5Gnwaqvy56WnZ1nm7J5spdmaZptkWJ%2BcrHEZm9snmZis3R8kJuYn2xpm4N3esetpKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
