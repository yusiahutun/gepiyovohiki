While on holiday in December into New Years, what started as tonsillitis spiraled into critical septic shock, which infected and affected several of my organs. I am grateful that my health has improved despite what we had initially been told," Park wrote alongside several shots of her in a hospital bed.</p><p>By her side was Paul Forman, who plays one of Park's love interests in the hit Netflix series and has been linked to her romantically IRL as well. Forman, Park said, was by her side through her entire hospital stay, with the 32-year-old actress thanking her co-star for calming her fears during the truly terrifying time.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"Grateful most of all to @peforman for being unconditionally by my side through all this. You calmed my fears and held me through ambulances, three foreign hospitals, a week in the ICU, scary ERs, countless scans and tests and injections, excruciating pain, and so much confusion all while we were alone on the other side of the world far from those we know," she continued. "I love you Paul. More than I can ever say."</p><p>Park also took a moment to thank all the doctors and nurses that helped her along the way, as well as her team of "heroes at home" who helped her with insurance, and her parents for coming to her aid from afar.</p><p>"I hesitated to share what's been happening as I'm still in the throes of recovery‚Ä¶," the Joy Ride star added, "but I now know I'm safely on the other side of the worst."</p><p>"Thanks for reading this. I'm sorry for being so absent recently to so much and to people in my life," she said, concluding the lengthy post. "I love you all.
