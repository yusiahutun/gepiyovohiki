As part of this collaboration, the renowned Friends Arena in Stockholm, a hub for major live entertainment events, will undergo a transformation and be officially renamed Strawberry Arena.</p><p>This iconic venue has been a cornerstone for the world’s top touring acts, hosting successful performances, major conferences, and exhibitions and serving as Sweden’s national football arena. ASM Global, the venue operator, and Strawberry Hotel Group boasting over 240 hotels in the region, aim to elevate the already market-leading live entertainment experiences for guests, fans, members, customers, and artists.</p><p><strong>Petter Stordalen, owner and founder of Strawberry,</strong> said, “The new name, Strawberry Arena, symbolizes experience and diversity, setting the arena as a place for energy, courage, and enthusiasm. The best concerts will continue to be held here, and football fans will cheer and cry; there will be something for everyone. Strawberry wants to continue to create a space for monumental meetings, experiences, and moments in Sweden and the Nordic region together with ASM Global. We are incredibly proud that the arena will be named Strawberry Arena.”</p><p>The partnership coincides with a vibrant year for the arena, featuring National Team matches, the Stockholm football derby, and headlining performances by international megastars like Taylor Swift, Pink, and Bruce Springsteen. Additionally, major events such as Melodifestivalen, Tech Arena, and Sweden International Horse Show are on the agenda.</p><p>Strawberry plans to enhance the VIP experience for its members with exclusive entrances, specially tailored member events, and Strawberry lounges in collaboration with its adjacent hotels, Quality Hotel Friends and Comfort Hotel Solna. The goal is to establish the arena as the go-to-meeting space for extraordinary moments.</p><p>“In July, the arena will change its name to Strawberry Arena, and this is a major milestone for our group and our history in Sweden. Most people see us as a hotel company, but we offer everything from small experiences that spice up everyday life to “once-in-a-lifetime” experiences. With Strawberry Arena, we will create memorable meetings and spread the message that diversity in the world is just as important as diversity in experiences,” says <strong>Carl Oldsberg, chief digital officer at Strawberry</strong>.</p><p>Despite the renaming, the Foundation Friends and its anti-bullying initiatives will continue to be a prominent presence in the arena. Through a new agreement, this commitment will extend to ASM Global’s other arenas in Sweden, reinforcing their dedication to social responsibility.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4FwfJBoaG5nkai6brPLqJmapF2osqTB0Z6qZqaRoravs4yroKCgpKh6pbHApWSfp6JiwLixw56lrGWelsGqu82ao2arn5iwpr6MrKuanJmqunA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
