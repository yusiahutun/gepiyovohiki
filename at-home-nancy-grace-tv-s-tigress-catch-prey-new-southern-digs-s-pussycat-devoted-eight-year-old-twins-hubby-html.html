Now they were the right length.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She credits her mother, Elizabeth, for teaching her how to 'do stuff'.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Mom canned our food, made our clothes, I grew up thinking if you can imagine it you can jerry rig it and do it.
