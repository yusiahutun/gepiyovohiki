The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">energy of the 6</a> is loving, nurturing, and unconditional in its generosity. So don’t hold back—it’s time to show your friends, family, and community that you care.</p><p>Expect to be called into service of some kind this month. Perhaps a new community group will seek you out for your expertise. A colleague could need an extra hand with a project, or even your children could need a little more emotional support than usual.</p><p>Whatever it is, try to give yourself willingly. You may feel like whatever’s being asked of you interferes with the responsibilities you already have, but this is most likely an illusion. Stay open to the balance shifting over the next four weeks. Give some of your duties over to others (you’ll probably find others are more than willing to take them off your hands). You don’t need to take on the world by yourself.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.5><h2>Action Item: Don't Neglect Yourself</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lovehoroscopefeb2023.png><p>At the same time, try not to fall into the trap of putting everybody else first this month. If left unchecked, the 6 can reveal us as martyrs very quickly. It’s important to fill your own cup and put appropriate boundaries in place.</p><p>During a 6 Universal Month, this often means finding creative outlets. If you can, weave these into the work you do each day, like cooking, cleaning, and other domestic arts. Relationships may take precedent throughout this 6 month as well. As the number of love, this is a great cycle to devote yourself to your significant other: What can you do to strengthen your bonds? These things don’t happen without effort—and the energy of the 6 will give you exactly the right kind of effort.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.5><h2>Calculate Your Personal Month Number</h2><p>Calculating your&nbsp;Personal Month number requires simple addition (no calculus here!) and allows you to find the most personalized numerology advice for the month. Just follow the below steps, and then scroll down for your custom August numerology forecast.</p><p>Step 1: Add the individual digits of your birth month and day. For example, if you were born on April 26, add 4 + 2 + 6 = 12.</p><p>Step 2: Add previous sum to the digits of the current year. For example, if you were calculating this answer in 1995, add 12 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 5 = 36.</p><p>Step 3: Reduce the previous sum to a single digit if needed. For example, 3 + 6 = 9.</p><p>Step 4: Add sum to current calendar month number. For example, if you were calculating this answer in May, add 9 + 5 = 14.</p><p>Step 5: Reduce the previous sum to a single digit if needed. For example, 1 + 4 = 9.&nbsp;The person in this example is experiencing a personal 9 month.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9><h2>Personal Month 1</h2><p>The energy of the number 1 charges into your life this month, enlivening your spirit. You’re determined to leave indecision behind and chart a new course. This vibration can feel spontaneous and even a little reckless, but changes you make now can springboard you into a whole new cycle. Expect new opportunities to enter your life!</p><p>You may meet a new person who is set to alter the entire direction you’re heading in. Tune in closely to your intuition. As the number 1 represents individuality, this time encourages self-trust above all else. If faced with a choice between your own instinct and the urge to please others, you must put yourself first.</p><p>The 1 is also the number of leadership, so your actions this month could pave the way for others to follow. Be aware that others are looking to your example. Act in authenticity.</p><p>Regardless of your Life Path Number, this could be an opportune time to call in some support. This is not because your cooperative skills are especially sharp (that will be next month!), but because you have so much to act on now—a little delegation is highly recommended.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.5><h2>Personal Month 2</h2><p>Expect things to get emotional this month. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though! During this time, you will begin to understand the inherent power of your inner workings. Your feelings are your guidance system—so gently start to trust them. This vibration could feel very vulnerable, if you stick with it, you can reap great rewards.</p><p>The Numerology of the 2 heightens sensitivity to situations and people, so your intuition is set to get a boost. Lean in! Listen deeply to other people. Observe body language and not just spoken words. Hold space for others to speak. Ask people questions about how they’re doing.</p><p>If you’re in a relationship, then intimacy could go through the roof this month! And if you’re looking for love, this is a great time for you to tune in closely to potential partners.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.5><h2>Personal Month 3</h2><p>Self-expression always gets a boost when the 3 shows up in a Numerology prediction. For you, the focus this month will be on communication.</p><p>You’re going to find yourself needing to talk, share, explain, describe, and spread your ideas far and wide, and you’ll have plenty of people willing to listen!</p><p>The 3 is naturally charming and full of allure, so you won’t have to try too hard to find your audience. Maintain your authenticity and make sure you’re not performing for the crowd. You may begin to like this whole attention thing and crave it when it drops off. It’s worth working on your self-resilience at this time.</p><p>With so much recognition coming your way, you may also notice some criticism show up. This is another natural side of the 3 frequency and a good reason to thicken your skin. Remember that you’re not everyone’s cup of tea, nor should you be. Keep showing up in your uniqueness—the world needs you!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.326361867704><h2>Personal Month 4</h2><p>After an exciting time of creative self-expression, this month is calling you to put your serious cap on.</p><p>Your work in the world is set to take center stage over the next four months, and this Numerology will make the required hard work a little easier. Your level of focus, dedication, and stamina will all get a boost—so make the most of this time.</p><p>Work methodically. If you’re prone to scattering your energy into too many projects at once, make yourself a timeline, a daily to-do list, and a reasonable schedule. This is a great month for you to get into some good habits that will carry you through the rest of the cycle.</p><p>This month may also bring you an unexpected connection with the past, perhaps through a long-lost relative or someone important you haven’t seen in a while. As the number of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ancestral healing</a>, the 4 encourages you to make bridges with your family roots. This is an ideal time to dig into your lineage or even tell stories of your own childhood to your kids, partner, or friends.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.5><h2>Personal Month 5</h2><p>The message of the month is to get flexible! No, not necessarily through exercise (though if that’s what you fancy, go ahead!). This is about cultivating a flexible mindset. The Numerology of the 5 brings change aplenty, so your main job over the coming weeks is to let it in.</p><p>Your relationships could start to feel like they don’t quite fit anymore. A friendship might suddenly seem stifling, or a co-worker may appear to be on an entirely different wavelength. These mismatched feelings are likely because you’re going through some big internal shifts. Try to embrace what’s changing in you. Your life is up-leveling considerably.</p><p>Look around for fresh inspiration. Read a new book. Visit a different city for the weekend. This time is all about opening your eyes, your mind, and your perspective! Don’t be worried about leaving people behind. If they are meant to be a part of your life, they will come along for the ride—or show up further down the road.</p><p>Have fun!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=13.5><h2>Personal Month 6</h2><p>Think domesticity isn’t sexy? It’s time to think again!</p><p>Your personal frequency this month opens a whole new world of homespun harmony as the Numerology of the 6 reminds you how much beauty, love, and creativity exists behind your own front door.</p><p>If you have a family, you’ll find ways to fall in love with them all over again. If you’re living alone or away from those you hold dear, then this is a really great time to reach out to them. They may need you, after all, so offer support, advice, a hot cup of tea, and a shoulder to lean on.</p><p>The 6 is generous and giving, but you’ll need to guard against overdoing it so you don’t deplete yourself. Offer yourself the same kindness.</p><p>This is also a great month for you to get crafty! Consider exploring an artform like weaving, macramé, pottery, or papercrafts. If you have a latent talent, this is the time to set it free!</p><p>Just beware of perfectionism popping up. The shadow of this number has a fierce inner critic, so temper any hyper-critical vibes that appear.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.5><h2>Personal Month 7</h2><p>You are in a 7 Personal Month, which holds restful and reflective energy. If you’ve been rushing around running everyone else’s errands, it’s time to focus on you.</p><p>This time is calling you to slow down and think more deeply about your own needs, wants, and desires. Whose agenda have you been working toward? Yours or somebody else’s?</p><p>Many find the energy of a 7 Personal Month frustrating, as society often programs people to pursue non-stop achievement. You must realize that the real work for you to do right now is internal.</p><p>Spend time this month with positive people who nourish and support you. Avoid those who are toxic and drain your energy.</p><p>You may find you’re more tired than usual because of the internal processing and deep healing that’s possible now. Try not to work against this by upping your coffee and tea intake. Instead, be your own guide. Sleep more. Turn off the TV. Treat your body like a temple and your mind like a precious sanctuary.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.5><h2>Personal Month 8</h2><p>Get ready for your big ambitions to start materializing! The frequency of the 8 brings abundance and blessings.</p><p>Take a moment to appreciate all the hard work that has brought you to this point—the skills developed, the effort applied, and the risks taken. Soak up your sense of accomplishment.</p><p>The Numerology of the 8 is helping you manifest your goals in a way you didn’t think was possible. Don’t limit yourself or your plans in any way. The 8 will stretch your wildest beliefs and make them so.</p><p>This is a good month for investments, legal cases, or business deals. You’ll likely make the right decisions for all involved—your heart and head are balanced right now.</p><p>Why not put some audacious plans in place? Your future self will thank you for your efforts today.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8><h2>Personal Month 9</h2><p>This month brings you to the end of a personal Numerology cycle. Something in your life is coming to a close—and you’re being asked to let it go.</p><p>This may be a relationship, a work project, a habit, or set of beliefs that are keeping you small.</p><p>Surrender can be difficult, but it’s a necessary part of your evolution. You’ve reached a fork in the road. You can stay as you are … or you can release an old version of yourself and rise to a new level.</p><p>It’s important to realize that if you don’t let go now, you’ll simply spend the next cycle playing out patterns and themes similar to the ones you just experienced. Holding tight to what’s ready to be released only delays your own progress.</p><p>Be compassionate with yourself this month. Go gently and give yourself grace and forgiveness. Remember that keeping energetic lines still attached through grudges doesn’t count as letting go! Your release needs to be heartfelt and genuine.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratflsKowdKtZKetnZq%2FsLjOoLBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
