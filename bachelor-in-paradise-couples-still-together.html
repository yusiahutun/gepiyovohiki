But I do have to be honest with you, um, my ex did just show up on the beach. Swear on my life,” Joe told Serena during his proposal. “But yeah, that just happened. If anything it just made me more confident in how much I do love you. When I left Paradise last time, I pretty much told myself, I would never come back. Two years go by, I found myself single and I’m like, yeah you know why not? What’s the worst that could happen? In all honesty I really didn’t think I’d fall in love again, what are the odds of that, right?”</p><p>He continued, “And then I met you. I wasn’t sure if you were going to be able to open up because maybe I was projecting, because I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to open up, but we did and the day you told me you were falling in love with me, you showed me how vulnerable you could be and after that I was all in. We have definitely had our speed bumps along the way, but the way you’ve handled it shows me what a kind and loving person you are. I’m really into you, your smile, your charm, your looks, this, this whole thing, the Toronto accent, um, it’s just really everything about you. It happened fast, faster than I thought, but at this point I don’t see myself not wanting to wake up with you by my side. When I think about forever, you know it’s, that’s scary, and then I think about it with you and I don’t know, it feels right. You told me you were falling in love with me first, you told me you love me first, now it’s my turn… Serena Pitt, I love you very much. Will you marry me?”</p><p>Joe and Serena married on October 27, 2022, at City Hall. They had an official wedding on September 2, 2023. Before Bachelor in Paradise Season 7, Joe was a contestant on The Bachelorette Season 14 with Becca Kufrin, where he went home in Week 1. He was also a contestant on Bachelor in Paradise Season 6, where he met and dated Kendall Long (The Bachelor Season 22). Joe and Kendall split in Week 5 but got back together after filming ended. They announced their breakup on January 29, 2020. Serena, for her part, was a contestant on The Bachelor Season 25 with Matt James, where she went home in Week 8.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfl66ktMSlpqtlmaN6sa3Rmpuiq5VisLDBz6WcrGWjqbatuIytpqCdpJ2ys3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
