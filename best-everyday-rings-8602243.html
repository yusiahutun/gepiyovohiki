That means they’re always well-moisturized, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>nails are lacquered</a>, and my fingers are carrying an array of rings.

There’s no denying that the right accessories — be it a touch of gold on the neck or a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>bold hoop earrings</a> — can make or break an outfit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you’re looking for a variety of pieces to rotate through a week or a single item you hope to wear daily for the foreseeable future, we found a ring in every possible material to suit your needs. We even tapped professional nail artists, whose fingers remain on the pulse where trendy jewelry is concerned, to offer some tips on how to style and stack jewelry. Other stylists with extensive experience handling high-quality jewelry for their clients give insight into what products you can turn to for specific occasions. From <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>giftable jewelry</a> to dainty stackable pieces, from costume jewelry to solid gold, we found the best everyday rings to shop this season.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-mejuri-figure-ring></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mejuri Figure Ring</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mejuri Figure Ring" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZrZnRSE9giXM7x-dyBkjNOJSgBg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mejuri-figure-ring-76bb5556bb164a6ea5509047f77667f6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mejuri</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The 18-karat gold vermeil on sterling silver will last a long time without creating markings on your skin.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Reviewers claim the band shows scratches easily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Mejuri cracked the balance of luxury, quality, and affordability, making them one of the most sought-after jewelry brands. This Figure Ring has an asymmetrical wave design circulating the finger. It’s rather thick, measuring 5.8 millimeters in width, which gives it a bit of an opulent appeal that makes a statement without going into the color, diamond, or gemstone categories. And while it’s not made of solid gold, it is a step above your average gold-plated brass jewelry. Using 18-karat gold vermeil, Mejuri’s embossed sterling silver with a thick layer of gold won’t easily weather. Because there’s no brass in its makeup, it’s also hypoallergenic and won’t create any green markings on your finger. However, some reviewers have commented that with time, the ring shows scratches on its surface. Make sure to avoid wearing it on days you know you’ll be working with your hands a lot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>4–10 | <strong>Material: </strong>18-karat gold vermeil on sterling silver<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-oomiay-kombucha-ring></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Oomiay Kombucha Ring</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Oomiay Kombucha Ring " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/soC6s5_Ttk4xUPks7CqMH8Fyyy0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/oomiay-kombucha-ring--261737b5dd454da7b424ac4a7b99f962.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Oomiay</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s made of hypoallergenic brass, so anyone can enjoy the accent piece.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It does not feel as sturdy as some of the other options on this list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I needed some new rings in my daily rotation, so when Oomiay offered to send me a few pieces, I jumped at the opportunity. The Kombucha ring was my favorite piece that arrived in the mailbox. This dainty little number adds a subtle and beautiful touch of color to my hand without being too loud. At the center, a green olive crystal sits comfortably in its prong. Surrounding it is a row of glass crystals, and combined, the tiny accents look elegant and eye-catching. I will say that as a budget piece, it does not feel as sturdy as some of my other jewelry pieces. But considering I only take it out to switch up my bling every once in a while, it’s exactly what I was looking for.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>4–11<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>14-karat gold over brass, glass crystal, cubic zirconia crystal<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-herms-chaine-dancre-enchainee-ring></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hermès Chaine D’Ancre Enchainee Ring</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Herm&amp;Atilde;&amp;uml;s Chaine D&amp;acirc;Ancre Enchainee Ring" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Dbnffjrwn9O2wchHWE1UMgB383E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/herms-chaine-dancre-enchainee-ring-2b6e241e4bb64aa2b8cb0aecaa88b877.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>HermÃ¨s</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s made of pure sterling silver and will last a lifetime.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>While there is a rose gold version, the price is significantly higher.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I’ll admit it: I think about Hermès far too often considering my humble status. But while I’m a long way away from ever owning a Birkin bag, some of the jewelry and beauty pieces aren’t so far out of reach. Take this gorgeous Chaine D’Ancre ring, for example. This subtle piece is the epitome of quiet luxury, featuring an interlocking chain in pure sterling silver. It’s available in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">rose gold</a> as well, a far more valuable material, and that’s reflected in the price differential. Stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Jamie Grimstad</a> believes in prioritizing quality over quantity, “especially for a piece that you’re going to wear every day (that means that from the start, your cost-per-wear is going to be low).” If you want to invest in a piece, she suggests looking in the $500–$2,000 range, and this Hermès option is right in there. It makes for a great entry point to investment jewelry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>46–56<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Sterling silver<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-gold-maya-brenner-link-ring></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Gold</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Maya Brenner Link Ring</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Maya Brenner Link Ring " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Dck096_pEhzd0jk_1j48y0o9E_8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/maya-brenner-link-ring-3ca99a8eff8e4318943aebfd267150df.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Maya Brenner</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The 14-karat yellow gold is sturdy, strong, and won’t weather down.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The ring sizes offered are not that inclusive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dangling on my wrist as I write this is a 14-karat yellow gold <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Maya Brenner bracelet</a>. (That’s actually my hand pictured under the ‘shop this look’ section.) I never take it off, and it’s become one of my favorite jewelry pieces of all time. No shower, no amount of sleep, and no harsh weather have changed the quality of this piece, so I can confidently say that this ring (made of the same material) will do the same. The design is simple and elegant, making it easy to stack with other options on this list as well. And unlike the Hermès piece, the price does not fluctuate by color or material. We have to wonder, however, why the sizing is so limited on this number!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>4–8<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>14-karat gold<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-silver-diamond-nexus-petite-dome-ring-sterling-silver></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Silver</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Diamond Nexus Petite Dome Ring Sterling Silver</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Diamond Nexus Petite Dome Ring Sterling Silver" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jVeNbVIwb9b8OyeXKOg85DOLqWU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/diamond-nexus-petite-dome-ring-sterling-silver-e4de50dc6abc4a558f3c1716d183a7c7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Diamond Nexus</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Diamond Nexus offers a wide range of ring sizes, including quarter and half sizes.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s a trend piece, meaning it could go out of style in a few years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Diamond Nexus has everything from engagement rings and lab grown diamonds to costume jewelry and unique gemstones. Whatever your jewelry needs, it’s likely you’ll find a solution here. They’re also one of the few retailers that offer an impressive array of ring sizes, including quarter- and half-sizes. These baguette-dome rings have been very popular as of late, but because it’s such a dainty (albeit unique) look, we can imagine it will remain a staple for years to come. You may as well get yourself a sterling silver piece that won’t break the bank — or turn your finger green. This option is on the slightly slimmer side, so you won’t have any trouble stacking it with other jewelry pieces.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>4–10<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Sterling silver<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-diamond-jean-dousset-olivia-round-brilliant-lab-diamond-eternity-band></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Diamond</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jean Dousset Olivia Round Brilliant Lab Diamond Eternity Band</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jean Dousset Olivia Round Brilliant Lab Diamond Eternity Band" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XQCcHC8uwJtwNG1576wGfSXRckA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jean-dousset-olivia-round-brilliant-lab-diamond-eternity-band-c9028773c4164e63a148367d5c357fa6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jean Dousset</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You can add a complimentary engraving on the band.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>As the diamond width increases, the price nearly doubles each time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Jean Dousset — Louis-François Cartier’s great-great-grandson — took his expertise in the industry and created his own label of fine <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lab-grown diamond jewelry</a>. Scrolling through their array of glitzy diamond pieces, it’s almost impossible to single one out, so consider this eternity band an entry piece to the brand. The slim ring is adorned with approximately 27 lab-grown diamonds (it varies by ring size) with a clarity of VS1+, one of the highest ratings. Each round stone is .04 carat, and they lie on an 18-karat white-gold band. It’s also available in rose gold, yellow gold, and platinum. The best part? You can personalize it by adding a little engraving in the interior of the band, which comes at no extra cost.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>3–10<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>18-karat white gold, lab grown diamonds<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-costume-ana-luisa-amara-black-gold-signet-ring></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Costume</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ana Luisa Amara Black Gold Signet Ring</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ana Luisa Amara Black Gold Signet Ring" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/IEMcXv3j4-Hk41anN_dYU8YPU8s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ana-luisa-amara-black-gold-signet-ring-7f89f8761c944150bd8dba3a166c8e69.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ana Luisa</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This ring is hypoallergenic, water-resistant, and non-tarnishing.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The center stone is not so sturdy and has fallen off for a customer before.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ana Luisa is one of our favorite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>affordable jewelry brands</a>. They’re always introducing fun, trendy, and stylish jewelry that we don’t have to break the bank to access. If you’re someone who likes to be playful with their bling and rotate through a number of rings, then this is the place to go. Take this Black Gold Signet Ring, for example. It makes a statement but can still be worn with just about anything. It’s non-tarnishing, hypoallergenic, and water-resistant, although we still recommend keeping it out of water just to be safe. One reviewer has complained that the center stone fell off after a few weeks, but thanks to the two-year warranty, you can easily get any problems fixed for free.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–10<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>14-karat gold plated brass, black onyx, cubic zirconia<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-stackable-kendra-scott-livy-gold-rings-set-of-3></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Stackable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kendra Scott Livy Gold Rings Set of 3</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kendra Scott Livy Gold Rings Set of 3" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bvv-hOwGKI-X9TRNHkMRVx1Mw0Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kendra-scott-livy-gold-rings-set-of-3-03bd8e840a994388aec0265c166ccc73.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kendra Scott</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You get three rings in one set.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They can tarnish with lots of wear or contact with water.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s something so satisfying about having a stack of rings that perfectly mismatch. Rather than hunting down a number of rings that could work together without clashing, you can get a set of three rings from Kendra Scott that are made to be stacked. Two of the rings are glitzed with a row of white crystals, and one ring features two bands crossing each other. Wear them all on top of each other or spread them around your 10 fingers — however you choose to wear them, the classic rings are sure to elevate any outfit. As they are gold-plated brass, they don’t weather water well and could tarnish. Make sure to take them off each time you wash your hands.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–9 | <strong>Material: </strong>14-karat gold plated brass, white crystal<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-statement-fossil-watch-ring-two-hand-gold-tone-stainless-steel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Statement</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fossil Watch Ring Two-Hand Gold Tone Stainless Steel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fossil Watch Ring Two-Hand Gold Tone Stainless Steel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/j57mHGJQh0xpfhHzNibmTOnEfcM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fossil-watch-ring-two-hand-gold-tone-stainless-steel-cf7ae9e65d3e4dcbbe731f4e9adb32bb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Fossil</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It actually tells you minutes and hours like a normal watch, just on your finger.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Eventually you’ll need to get a new battery for the watch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I was recently gifted this Watch Ring from Fossil, and I don’t think I ever loved a quirky piece of jewelry more. This is as good a statement as it gets — it tells the time! The tiny window actually has a full watch in it, telling you minutes and hours, and you can dial it if it ever loses its battery. (It hasn’t so far.) I’m trying to lower my screen time, and this has been a fun and stylish way to check the time without pulling out my phone. I don’t even have to squint to see the dials, as the time is perfectly easy to read. It’s become a great conversation starter, and about half my acquaintances have asked me where it’s from since I’ve started wearing it. Should it ever run out of battery, I’ll have to take it to the store to get it fixed. That could be a little tedious, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get there!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>One size<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Stainless steel<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hypoallergenic-pandora-sparkling-herbarium-cluster-ring></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hypoallergenic</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pandora Sparkling Herbarium Cluster Ring</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pandora Sparkling Herbarium Cluster Ring" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/RfCiW688247kIqe6BYt3WpBhNPQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pandora-sparkling-herbarium-cluster-ring-efafeb3483f4431ba1183b0c2c528cfb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Pandora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It looks a lot more luxurious than the cost.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We recommend taking delicate care of the rocks so as not to destroy them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What used to be everyone’s favorite mall jewelry brand is now one of the leading lights in everyday ornaments — and even lab grown diamonds. I wanted to highlight this sparkly ring that’s slim and dainty enough for everyday wear. Front and center are three petal-shaped stones, which are surrounded by a row of clear cubic zirconia. These rocks sit on a sterling silver band, which won’t tarnish with time and is hypoallergenic. This ring looks luxurious — particularly for the price — and could be paired with any outfit or ring combo. Still, we recommend removing the ring when you wash your hands, as the stones could potentially fall out with improper care.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>4.5–9 | <strong>Material: </strong>Sterling silver, cubic zirconia<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-birthstone-james-allen-diamond-accent-birthstone-ring></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Birthstone</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>James Allen Diamond Accent Birthstone Ring</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="James Allen Diamond Accent Birthstone Ring" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UfeJmsUhamkN6sWICkeSUAAk-Ls=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/james-allen-diamond-accent-birthstone-ring-8bd5b8398e654168a8e2285a22b234b4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>James Allen</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There’s a birthstone to go with each month of the year.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The size options are limited.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">James Allen got its start by making engagement rings, so you trust they know what they’re doing where rings are concerned, and now they’re here to serve the astrology buffs and birth-chart readers. It has just the right amount of personalization without getting something customized and engraved. Once you choose your stone, you can select whether you want it on a pure 14-karat white- or yellow-gold band. Because of its material makeup, it will stand the test of time and never tarnish. It’s a ring you can keep close to your heart for a lifetime, making the not-so-steep investment well worth the price. However, there aren’t many size options available, and if your size isn’t listed, we recommend contacting a representative who may be able to guide you through custom-building a ring.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–9<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>14-karat white or yellow gold<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>11</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Material: </strong>Material should be the first thing you consider when shopping for everyday rings once you’ve found a design that speaks to you. For nail artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Sydney Fisher,</a> who is constantly showcasing her array of rings, finding pieces that are solid 14-karat gold is essential for every day as they won’t tarnish and can handle excessive wear. Because rings are on your hands and your hands go through a lot of washing, touching, and sweating throughout the day, opting for the right material is all the more important for rings than for bracelets, writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Diana Tsui</a> reminds us. Having something that is “at least 14-karat gold, platinum, or sterling silver, to ensure that they'll hold up over time” is crucial, she says. But of course, solid gold comes at a higher price point than gold-plated items. Gold can be plated over brass&nbsp;or over sterling silver. The first is a more affordable option, making it great for costume rings that are on constant rotation. The latter is more durable and is a great alternative for those who want long-lasting rings without investing in a solid gold piece.</li><li><strong>Size: </strong>It’s worth knowing your exact ring size before ordering your piece. A simple and easy way to measure your size is by taking a string, wrapping it around your finger, and taking note of where the string ends meet. Measure this length against a ruler in millimeters. Then take <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">this chart from Mejuri</a> under “Rings” to see which size corresponds to your measurements. Remember to measure the finger you hope to carry the ring on, as each of your fingers will vary slightly in size.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you take care of rings?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">How you take care of your rings will depend on the material. Solid gold items, whether they’re 14- or 18-karat, will not be affected by water and therefore can be worn in the shower or while washing hands. Solid gold will not tarnish and is therefore the easiest to take care of, not to mention the most long-lasting. So while it’s a bigger investment to make initially, it will pay off in the span of your lifetime, your children’s lifetime, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Gold-plated items, on the other hand, need a little extra TLC. You want to take off items while you sleep or shower. After a day’s wear, you can rub them with a cotton ball (without water) to remove any smudges and keep them looking sparkly. While sterling silver is more durable than brass, it still can tarnish. For this reason, you want to remove it before hopping in the water if you wish to lengthen its lifespan. Grimstad keeps her jewelry in a padded jewelry box “to ensure that it stays safe and free from scratches.” <strong><br></strong></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you clean tarnished jewelry?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In the case that your jewelry has already tarnished, fear not: there are ways to clean it up. Take one tablespoon of washing soda and pour it into a bowl that’s covered in aluminum foil. Pour boiling water into the bowl and drop your tarnished jewelry in. Make sure it’s fully covered and allow the jewelry to sit in the mixture for a few minutes. Remove them with tongs and place on a paper napkin. Once the jewelry has cooled, use a gentle washcloth to rub the moisture off and remove any residue.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Should you take rings off when washing hands?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your jewelry isn’t made of solid gold, you should always remove it before washing hands, showering, or swimming. Only gold items won’t tarnish from water. That being said, if you’re swimming in a big open space, it would still be beneficial to remove all jewelry to make sure you don’t lose it.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you stack rings?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fisher, who at any given time is wearing two or three rings on one hand, recommends “combining more bold pieces with dainty pieces.” Take note of what you will be wearing on that day as well — “keeping the designs simple so they go with most outfits” is a useful tip to go by. Meanwhile, Grimstad enjoys “mixing metals right now. When building the perfect ring stack, think about different widths, textures, and metals to create an elevated look.” Lastly, Tsui suggests “adding bits of color, whether in the form of enamel or stones. I also like the idea of loading up some fingers more than others. Since I wear my wedding rings, &nbsp;I'll also load up my index finger, but I'll only wear one ring on my middle finger to balance it out.”<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bianca Kratky</a> is a commerce writer covering fashion and beauty.
