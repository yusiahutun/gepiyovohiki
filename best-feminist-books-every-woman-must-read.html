In Revolting Prostitutes, Molly Smith and Juno Mac—both sex workers themselves—are bringing their perspectives to the forefront of the conversation. By looking at different legal models and identifying the ways that migration, race, and feminism come into play with their industry, the duo make a compelling case for full decriminalization, arguing that prohibitive laws harm sex workers more than they empower them.</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">6</span><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7"><i>A Kick in the Belly: Women, Slavery and Resistance</i> by Stella Dadzie</h2><img alt=text data-cy=slide-image-6 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/91ffhndbstl-sl1500-65e1040c774df.jpg title=text width=993 height=1500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Amazon Prime</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Kick-Belly-Women-Slavery-Resistance/dp/1788738845 data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Buy rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">Buy</a></p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In this enlightening work of nonfiction, British-Ghanaian activist and historian Dadzie unearths the forgotten histories of enslaved women who played a key role in resisting and fighting back against slavery in the West Indies. In addition to chronicling the devastating conditions of life on a plantation and the cruel conduct of slave captors, Dadzie also brings to light the small but critical gestures of defiance activated by enslaved women, re-centering them as agents of their own destiny in the historically white-washed movement for abolition.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">7</span><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7"><i>My Body</i> by Emily Ratajkowski</h2><img alt=text data-cy=slide-image-7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/71qpyy4sffl-sl1500-65e102b3531d8.jpg title=text width=971 height=1500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Amazon Prime</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/My-Body-Emily-Ratajkowski/dp/1250817862 data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Buy rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">Buy</a></p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In this collection of essays, Ratajkowski uses her career as one of the most sought-after models today as a framework to contend with the ways in which women’s bodies are commodified. Armed with a lifetime of exploitative experiences dealing with skeevy agents and abusive photographers, Ratajkowski taps into the emotional whiplash of being a woman—on the one hand, desired and lusted after and, on the other, viewed as a contemptuous inferior.</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">8</span><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7"><i>Feminism for the 99%: A Manifesto</i> by&nbsp;Cinzia Arruzza,&nbsp;Tithi Bhattacharya&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nancy Fraser</h2><img alt="book cover" data-cy=slide-image-8 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/81aryuobjnl-sl1500-65e10446ee864.jpg title="book cover" width=936 height=1500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Amazon Prime</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Feminism-99-Nancy-Fraser/dp/1788734424 data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Buy rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">Buy</a></p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This trio of authors, who helped organize the International Women’s Strike in the U.S., attempt to reorient the priorities of mainstream liberal feminists in this powerful manifesto.

Much of that is owed to work by writers like famed poet and author Audre Lorde, who brought a Black, queer, feminist perspective to the forefront of the cultural discussion in this iconic collection of essays and speeches on racism, sexism, and homophobia.</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">18</span><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7"><i>The Bell Jar</i> by Sylvia Plath</h2><img alt="Font, Poster, Text, Book cover, Graphic design, Advertising, Illustration, Fictional character, " data-cy=slide-image-18 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-feminist-books-the-bell-jar-1520890949.jpg title="Font, Poster, Text, Book cover, Graphic design, Advertising, Illustration, Fictional character, " width=800 height=1200 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a data-external=true href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Bell-Jar-Modern-Classics/dp/0060837020/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Buy class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">Buy</a></p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The semi-autobiographical story of one woman’s descent into mental illness in the 1950s, The Bell Jar has become a quintessential coming-of-age story for young feminists. Moody and sometimes terse, the prose beautifully encapsulates a moment in the female experience—the desire, disillusionment, and fear of being young, confused, and stifled by the role that society has prescribed.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">19</span><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7"><i>The Bloody Chamber</i> by Angela Carter</h2><img alt="Head, Line art, Illustration, Drawing, Wildlife, Art, Coloring book, Black-and-white, Visual arts, Mythology, " data-cy=slide-image-19 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-bloody-chamber-1520964274.jpg title="Head, Line art, Illustration, Drawing, Wildlife, Art, Coloring book, Black-and-white, Visual arts, Mythology, " width=800 height=1200 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a data-external=true href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Bloody-Chamber-Stories-75th-Anniversary-Classics/dp/0143107615/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Buy class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">Buy</a></p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you've ever enjoyed a feminist retelling of a classic fairy tale, you owe a debt to Angela Carter, whose 1979 collection of short stories birthed a subgenre all its own. The tales—which include murderous Little Red Riding Hoods, vampiric Sleeping Beauties, a Beauty who becomes the Beast and the wife of Bluebeard turning the tables—remain some of the rawest and most clever examples of the style, and everlasting proof of Carter’s talent.</p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">20</span><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7"><i>This Bridge Called My Back</i> by Multiple Writers</h2><img alt="Text, Poster, Font, Book cover, Photo caption, Fictional character, Plant, Illustration, " data-cy=slide-image-20 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-feminist-books-this-bridge-called-my-back-1520890952.jpg title="Text, Poster, Font, Book cover, Photo caption, Fictional character, Plant, Illustration, " width=800 height=1200 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a data-external=true href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/This-Bridge-Called-Back-Fourth/dp/1438454384/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Buy class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">Buy</a></p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This anthology series features personal essays, criticism, poetry, and even visual art made by more than a dozen feminist women of color. It explores the ways their intersecting identities—gender, race, sexuality, class—shape the ways in which they relate to the world and the way the world, in turn, relates to them. Though originally published in the ’80s, the issues they present, and the perspectives they stand for, remain as pertinent to today’s feminist landscape as they were more than 30 years ago.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/bcf4ede8-fe3d-4d01-960b-39d06ef3fe67_1490202839.jpg alt="Headshot of Lauren Hubbard" title="Headshot of Lauren Hubbard" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Lauren Hubbard is a freelance writer and Town & Country contributor who covers beauty, shopping, entertainment, travel, home decor, wine, and cocktails.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/3ac58a4f-5cbc-4003-9811-5f7e18b418a4_1585686898.png alt="Headshot of Keely Weiss" title="Headshot of Keely Weiss" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Keely Weiss is a writer and filmmaker.
