As celebrity stylist and curly hair aficionado, Nai’vasha Johnson says, “a heat protectant serves as our hair’s health insurance insurance.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Coating your hair in a safety blanket may sound like a bit of a downer, but these multitasking formulas are more than just a coat of armor between your hair and the sizzling hot styling tool you’re aiming to use. These weightless barriers seal the cuticle to protect strands, block frizz, supercharge shine, and leave it feeling silky, soft, and totally touchable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sound unbelievable? We thought so too, so we nabbed a roster of InStyle editors across a range of hair types and textures, and tested the buzziest, most popular heat protectants out there. Over five weeks, we intensely scrutinized every aspect of these heat protectants, from the way they made our hair look and feel, to the scent to just how long we had to wait for them to absorb. Then we scorched our strands with hot tools at 450 degree heat to see just how well they defended our hair. We awarded bonus points to products that also nailed other benefits we long for, like a boost in hydration, glossy radiance, and no trace of a flyaway. Then we compared notes, scored, and ranked each product to create this list of options that can really do it all.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-shu-uemura-netsu-design-blow-dry-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shu Uemura Netsu Design Blow Dry Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Shu Uemura Netsu Blow Dry Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/H-Ew3lwFhPts3KDLrvvoOJGT454=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shu-uemura-netsu-blow-dry-cream-48d580cb1fb54bd198e1ddb1fe2204df.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The lightweight formula is chock-full of vitamins and proteins that left our hair feeling moisturized, and more voluminous.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It doesn’t hold styles in place—you’ll need a hairspray for that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This multifaceted cream from Shu Uemura seemed to be part heat protectant, part luxurious salon treatment, earning it the prized top spot on our list and our vanity. Not only did this spray effectively protect our strands from heat damage, it also tackled frizz and zhuzhed our lifeless, flat strands so well that we considered ditching all of our other styling products in favor of just this one.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What makes this cream a triple threat is the hearty dose of beeswax in the formula, releasing a tsunami of moisturizing fatty acids and strand-strengthening antioxidants that gave our hair such a noticeable softness and glossy shine that we felt like even our grown-out highlights had a new life and radiance to them.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=1></span> Even better, the protein-rich <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>castor oil</a> in the formula keeps working as the cream continues to sink into strands to repair frazzled ends and prevent new ones from starting.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Considered a blow dry cream, it applies the same way that a salt spray or hairspray would, except that the mist is a milky cream. And we could tell right away that this was a highly concentrated formula that wasn’t fooling around, evidenced by the lack (read: zero) of crimp marks or flyaways left behind after we straightened it. We were particularly thrilled with the way it kept the hair around our fringe smooth, giving us hope that we can finally master the art of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>micro French-girl bang</a>. Actually, throughout testing, our confidence grew in its protective abilities—we didn’t even worry when we bumped our flat iron up to a higher temperature than normal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, it’s a little pricier than other protectants but we think it’s worth spending a little extra considering how, aside from a hairspray to hold our styles in place, we didn’t need to apply our usual finishing products, like rich oils and leave-ins.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Cream<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Beeswax, castor oil<strong> |</strong> <strong>Heat Protection:</strong> Up to 450 degrees <strong>| Size:</strong> 5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-chi-total-protect></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>CHI Total Protect</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ulta CHI Total Protect" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Zuh-jQPZl9A13aAlOne6J5w9rFI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chi-1f71c3b2f41c4d2f9d5d34b50c86b713.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Ingredients like hydrolyzed silk and vitamin E, give this cream hair-resorting benefits to help reverse damage from color treatments and heat.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>When applied to dry hair, the cream is a little sticky upon initial application.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Chi is no stranger to making <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>affordable products that actually work</a>, and this gem of a primer gives the gift of a shiny halo all around our heads. This formula relies on the conditioning properties of hydrolyzed silk to bestow this angelic glow. It also makes the cream’s texture feel velvety and nourishing, likely the reason it’s been shown to help heal and restore protein to our strands from all the time we spend under foils coloring our hair.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=6></span>&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, UV absorbers which boast similar benefits and work alongside vitamin E&nbsp; act as an iron curtain against heat damage, both man-made in our hot tools and nature’s UV rays.&nbsp;We also appreciate the inclusion of lavender and peppermint extracts that may help spur hair growth.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=7></span> We hope to see the fruits of that with continued use, but in the meantime, we’ll just be enjoying the calming herbal scent of a ritzy spa.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only aspect that gave us pause was that our hair felt a little sticky when we initially applied it to our dry hair. It made us worry that the moisture would cause our hair to steam if we used a flat iron or leave us with a tacky finish, but our doomsday qualms were soon quashed when we ran our fingers through our silky smooth hair after styling it—no steam hijinks here.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Cream<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Silk, vitamin E, UV absorbers | <strong>Heat Protection:&nbsp; | Size: </strong>6 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-damaged-hair-olaplex-no9-bond-protector-nourishing-hair-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Damaged Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Olaplex No.9 Bond Protector</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Olaplex No. 9 Bond Protector Nourishing Hair Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Gmuyn6M8DiLlIfDBFtVSjiShRxo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Olaplex-No.-9-Bond-Protector-Nourishing-Hair-Serum-487332ddeb37421ba27d78e4b24ebdda.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Olaplex</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Damaged hair will thrive again—and this time, the antioxidant-rich ingredients in Olaplex’s patented bond-building system ensure it will be better protected from heat and environmental factors.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The added fragrance lingered on our hair all day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No one is safe from split ends, but one look at our brittle texture and fried ends reveal that we haven’t always been the most diligent with keeping our hair hydrated. And to be honest, we weren’t expecting a miracle, given the messy, vulnerable state our hair was in, but somehow, Olaplex managed to repair and strengthen our strands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What makes Olaplex special is the formula’s one-two punch starting with the brand’s proprietary bond-building system, leaning on the antioxidants, proteins, and amino acids provided by red algae to block hair from potential threats, such as pollution and UV radiation. In fact, some studies link red algae to quicker hair growth, giving us hope that we could see fuller hair with continued use.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=2></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Together with nourishing emollient panthenol and shine-boosting citric acid, the serum coated our hair in a lustrous vibrancy we’ve only ever seen in shampoo commercials. Despite relying on many rich oils to deliver gorgeous results, an even bigger surprise was that the cream felt weightless on our hair and absorbed in under 20 seconds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Basically, we only have nice things to say here, but we should note that the serum has a floral aroma that lasted all day, but we’re fans of peonies, so we loved catching a waft here and there.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Serum<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Bis-aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate, red algae extract |<strong> Heat Protection:</strong> Up to 450 degrees <strong>| Size: </strong>3 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dry-hair-moroccanoil-perfect-defense-heat-protectant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dry Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Moroccanoil Perfect Defense Heat Protectant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Moroccanoil Perfect Defense Heat Protectant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4TvIMNNQHmL2Qqmg5yiWfZctxHc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/moroccanoil-perfect-defense-heat-protectant-8455112016a94df9ad72c6de5583c3ca.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Argan oil revives dry, brittle strands without weighing down our hair or leaving behind a sticky residue that dampens hair.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We had to brush the product through our hair to avoid it getting clumpy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s no surprise the styling product that worked best to bring our hair back from the brink of dehydration relies on a foundation of argan oil to get the job done. Although many products and brands take advantage of the ultra-moisturizing and protein-restoring properties of this nut oil, Moroccanoil, the brand behind some of our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>favorite dry shampoos</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hair treatments</a>, developed a formula that sets it leaps and bounds above the competition.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Along with humectants panthenol and glycerin, the primer taps argan oil to seal the cuticles shut and lock moisture in, imparting a silky, glossy finish. Radiance aside, this dense oil pulls double duty by acting as a forcefield between hair and sun damage.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=3></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But that’s not all: When we dug a little deeper into the formula we uncovered shiitake mushroom, rosemary, and sage, all of which work to strengthen and maintain the health of the hair, and all its conditioning, shine-enhancing effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Those of us with dry hair are not strangers to styling products that hydrate our strands, but also envelop our whole head in a thick, heavy feeling. Yet, the mist here was fine, even, and settled nicely from root to tip, averting the familiar crisis of slicking back heavy hair into a messy bun.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Spray<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Argan oil, panthenol, octyl acrylamide | <strong>Heat Protection</strong>: Up to 450 degrees<strong> | Size:</strong> 8.1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lightweight-amika-blockade-heat-defense-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lightweight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Amika Blockade</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amika Blockade Heat Defense Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xck0_xBGTA3qjIhGLXphLrBdASc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amika-heat-defense-serum-13c38959de024920960260d1b6f7c1ab.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amika</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This formula only consists of nourishing ingredients that feel weightless on our strands, but it still includes everything to protect them from damage.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not the most hydrating serum we’ve used.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ll admit that we were a little skeptical about applying a thick serum to our hair (they have a reputation to be a bit sticky), especially given the fact it can be used on wet or dry hair. But whichever way we spritzed this Amika protectant—damp, dry, or somewhere in between—it never left a tacky, sticky residue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Amika’s not exactly known for subtly, evidenced by the brand’s whimsical psychedelic packaging, except, it seems, when it comes to the simple, but powerfully curated, list of ingredients in this primer. If the packaging is what first catches your attention, it’ll be the visible results that turn your head next.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When every ingredient counts, it’s hard to pinpoint one as the hero, but buckthorn oil and its army of 18 different amino acids, vitamin C and fatty acids in tow, comes pretty close.&nbsp; This jack-of-all-trades oil preserves hydration within each strand, while strengthening hair follicles and encouraging new hair growth<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=4></span>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Without a ton of heavy oils, which can be great for hydrating hair but can take us to greasy status pretty quickly, we feel the protectant could work well into our summer haircare routine, when our strands typically require less moisture than dry, winter months.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Serum<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Sea buckthorn oil | <strong>Heat Protection:</strong> Up to 450 degrees<strong> | Size: </strong>1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-frizz-briogeo-farewell-frizz-blow-dry-perfection--heat-protectant-crme></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Frizz</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Briogeo Farewell Frizz Blow Dry Perfection & Heat Protectant Crème</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Briogeo Farewell Frizz Blow Dry Perfection &amp;amp; Heat Protectant Cr&amp;egrave;me" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0vvcUH9xOrC-wXeThIwMWO9RTKI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/briogeo-farewell-frizz-blow-dry-perfection--heat-protectant-crme-7a3d6fb28bb54635a9a44458a9596a98.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>A trio of emollient-rich oils drenched our hair in moisture, effectively smoothing hair and taming flyaways after one use.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It takes a little longer to dissipate into the hair than other options.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it came to our head of flyaways, this serum had an immediate and impressive impact.

Similar to those formulas, this protective cream also taps argan and rosehip oils, whose slight heaviness slicks down errant flyaways, but coconut oil is the true star of the show here. It made our hair feel moisturized and lustrous, and we’re keen on the fact that coconut oil also works as a natural protector against heat by preventing protein loss and further damage.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=5></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Packed full of so many oils, we were worried the creamy primer might feel oppressive or wet—or, worse, give us a greaseball look—but it proved to do just the opposite.

Not only was our hair not scorched, it managed to make our hair look thicker and more voluminous, despite having just slathered our strands in Gisou’s sticky honey-based oil.

The heat protectants that earned our top scores are featured on this list.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most heat protectants are either a cream, serum, or spray. Regardless of your hair type, Nai’vasha always recommends a lightweight formula that won’t cause strands to look slick and oily. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Amika Heat Defense Serum</a> felt like practically nothing on our hair yet still dispensed plenty of heat-protecting benefits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, Olya Iudina, a stylist in New York City, recommends anyone with thin or medium hair types use sprays or serums. Meanwhile, those with thick, coarse, or curly hair may benefit most from a cream or balm “as they’re a little bit heavier and add more control while blow drying,” she says. We like the powerful humectants found in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Briogeo Blow Dry Perfection & Heat Protectant Crème</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ingredients&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our experts agree you should seek out oils, such as coconut and sweet almond, in a truly fantastic heat protectant as they coat the strands and “create a protective barrier when activated with heat,” says Johnson, who adds that since these oils are also super lightweight they won’t lead to wilted styles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Iudina also suggests looking for formulas with protein, like spirulina protein, which “works great for frizz control and smoothness,” she says. We’re fans of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kérastase Résistance Ciment Thermique Blow Dry Primer</a> in this regard because its formula has proteins and amino acids galore that strengthened our hair and boosted elasticity.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Weight</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Choosing a lightweight heat protectant is very important—anything too heavy can make your hard-earned styles fall flat. Yet if it takes too long to absorb, you could run the risk of touching wet hair with a hot flat iron which leads to sizzling and steam. Sticking with products that opt for plant-based ingredients, like those found in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Shu Uemura Netsu Blow Dry Cream</a>, or any that leave out silicones and sulfates, such as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">dpHue Color Fresh Thermal Protection Spray</a>, should keep you in the clear.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Does heat protectant work?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, just take it from the pros: “Hair should never be exposed to heat without this barrier,” says Johnson. She adds that heat protectants function like a barrier between your hair and the high temperatures from hot tools. To form this barrier, formulas usually feature ingredients like coconut oil, amino acids, and proteins that shield the hair cuticle from damage. Additionally, many formulas include hydrating emollients like squalane and glycerin to combat any dryness caused by heat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, you should think of heat protectants as a way to mitigate damage, not fully prevent it. There are other steps you can take to maintain the health of your hair like not setting hot tools above 300 degrees if possible, wearing a hat if you’re in the sun for a long time, and incorporating conditioning hair masks into your weekly hair care routine.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you use a heat protectant?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, the number one rule is always to use it before applying any kind of heat – that means blow drying, hot rollers, flat irons,&nbsp; and curling wands. Whether you’re using a cream or a spray, the key to applying any heat protectant is ensuring it's distributed throughout the hair. Just like with sunscreen, if you miss a spot it’s prone to the adverse effects of heat.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re using it on wet hair before you blow dry, Nai’vasha recommends applying it directly after towel drying the hair. “If it’s a spray, delicately and thoroughly mist from roots to ends, then, paddle brush throughout for even distribution,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The same can be said for creams—separate your hair into even sections and apply it liberally. Be sure you wait for it to fully absorb into your strands before going over it with your hot tool. You can usually tell by touching your hand to your hair and noticing if there’s a significant amount of residue.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why do you need a heat protectant?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Simply put, a heat protectant shields “your hair from heat, which may burn your hair, cause split ends, make your hair dry and lifeless,” says Iudina. Additionally, she adds, it can help your color-treated hair last longer. Without this safety net, hot tools strip your hair of its natural protein, making it weaker over time, disrupting natural curl patterns, and causing increased breakage.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-instyle-picks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What is InStyle Picks?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Did you notice the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle Picks seal of approval</a> at the top of this story?
