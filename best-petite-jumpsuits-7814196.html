From overwhelming fabrics and unflattering fits to bottoms that need to be cuffed or, even worse, altered, regular-length bottoms often seem made with someone else in mind. That's because they are. Even though people search for well-fitting garments, some brands still don't offer petites or extended sizing. And that's why, as a petite woman myself, I can't help but sigh when someone brings up jumpsuits.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"I can't wear those," I often say. Like many other short women, I've had negative experiences with jumpsuits in dressing rooms, leading me to see them as a combination of ill-fitted pants and a top that wouldn't quite suit my torso. As it turns out, I was shopping in the wrong places for my one-pieces and rompers. At times, I even ventured into the regular-sized sections — which, I'm sure, fellow short individuals can relate to — wishing, hoping, and praying that a cropped jumpsuit would somehow fit all the proportions of my body and not just in length. But trust us, petite jumpsuits actually exist —&nbsp;who knew! So to demonstrate that jumpsuits can fit petites seamlessly, we've compiled our favorites and a few expert recommendations, so you (hopefully!) never have to alter your jumpsuits again.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-loft-petite-emory-tie-front-jumpsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>LOFT Petite Emory Tie Front Jumpsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="LOFT Petite Emory Tie Front Jumpsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Iti_xigCDuliHpSxgv6USHpxbFY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/LOFT-Petite-Emory-Tie-Front-Jumpsuit-3bebb9d25c3c4cf0959216a5cd604ee4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>LOFT</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>How ultra-comfy this jumpsuit feels.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We wish it was available in more colorways.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It feels as though no brand is doing petites quite like Loft. With an expansive range of designs for those on the shorter side — from shirts and flowy blouses, work-appropriate pants, well-fitted jeans, and dresses that go from day to night — the casual lifestyle label under Ann Inc. (home of some of your favorites like Ann Taylor and Lou & Grey) knows how to cater to petite frames. Each piece is tailor-made to flatter smaller and shorter bodies. This super comfortable and drapey jumpsuit from the brand is no different; not only is it effortless in its one-and-done shape, but it’s also breezy and soft to the touch. It features a fastening tie to add definition to the body, a point collar, long sleeves with button cups, and adjustable front ties (as if the functionality and comfortability aspect could get any better). With a 25-inch inseam, the fabric lays right on the body without overwhelming and hits right at the ankle — an almost unseen feature for a jumpsuit. But, since this jumpsuit is made with shorter bodies in mind (in sizes 00-22), it fits true to size. We especially love how it can be dressed up or down because every jumpsuit is all about ease. It only comes in one color, but in our opinion, this jumpsuit is the epitome of the word.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00-22 |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material</strong>: Fluid woven | <strong>Inseam: </strong>25-inch</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-banana-republic-factory-poplin-jumpsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Banana Republic Factory Poplin Jumpsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Banana Republic Factory Poplin Jumpsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VG4KkmD4S7J3bhRXNwdW_vRIZmE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Banana-Republic-Factory-Poplin-Jumpsuit-098eb3384bbf49999d457ff192ddc07a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Banana Republic Factory</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The level of versatility this one-piece has when it comes to styling.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> This jumpsuit is final sale.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In true Banana Republic fashion, this utilitarian jumpsuit from the brand exudes both ease and style. This structured one-piece rings true to the label’s upscale aesthetic but also serves an exciting edge; it’s refined while remaining modern and — as easily as we can put it —&nbsp; cool. The detailings were inspired by vintage boiler suits, seen in the off-centered buttoned front and the rolled sleeves. It’s a retro piece with interesting and practical features, like the removable belt at the waist with lops, long sleeves with button tabs, and a point collar. The collar is slightly off-center from the button placket, giving it a trendy asymmetrical touch that aligns with trends <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>we’ve witnessed this season</a>. And while so many design details make this feel way more elevated than the price point suggests, we especially love how comfy this jumpsuit feels on the body. It has a roomier fit, so keep that in mind while purchasing, but it’s a relaxed fit that doesn’t feel as though it overwhelms the figure. The sinched belt gathers at the waist, and the petite-specific sizing allows this pleated beauty to hit right at the ankle.&nbsp;Be warned, you can't return it, since it's final sale, but we doubt you'll want to.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS-L |<strong> Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton | <strong>Inseam: </strong>29-inch</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-g-label-by-goop-birdie-sleeveless-parachute-jumpsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>G.

It’s a comfortable closet staple for work and play, made from soft canvas cotton. And not only is it super comfy, but it’s also effortlessly flattering. It's a contemporary feeling piece with a high-neck collar, sporty, cinchable cords at the neck, a slick zipper running down the torso, and parachute-inspired pants. The fit is roomy — not baggy, equipped with adjustable D-rings in the back for definition and for an edgy addition to the design. As for shorties concerned with the fit, despite not being a petite-specific offering, have no fear; the legs are cropped with a 25-inch inseam. And despite having a cool, harem pant look, the cropped wide legs are not so big that they seem ill-fitting on petite bodies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0-14 |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton | <strong>Inseam: </strong>25-inch</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-sotela-lima-jumpsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sotela Lima Jumpsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sotela Lima Jumpsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Zi6QXbpA48u1Tw0PmluzOAJa_BU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sotela-Lima-Jumpsuit-deb2422958114d5dbff23886811bd8d0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sotela</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The fabric is beautiful, soft, and seems fairly durable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It takes up to five weeks to ship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Designed for all bodies, from sizes 0-30, Sotela is an ethical, sustainable, and size-inclusive label founded in 2016 by Hanna Baror-Padilla. A favorite of model and writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Lydia Okello</a>, Sotela is a beloved brand by stylish people, both for its eco-consciousness and dedication to adequately fitted garments. And we mean properly done — each piece is made to order and customizable with your measurements. This jumpsuit, available in muted neutrals from mustard twill to rusty linen, is a best-seller, and with good reason. It comes with a wrapped belt that beautifully cinches the waist and a tapered leg. It’s a sleeveless one-piece with a flattering v-neck, but if you’re looking for something more winter-appropriate, Sotela also offers a long-sleeved version. The garment is structured yet soft to the touch and has a beautiful drape. According to its size chart, the petite inseam starts at 23.75 inches and increases as sizes go up to 26.75 inches. Since these pieces are made to order, though, there is a 3-5 week lead time after an order is placed, so plan ahead.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0-10 |<strong> Colors: </strong>5 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton twill | <strong>Inseam: </strong>Made-to-order</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-curvy-good-american-fit-for-success-jumpsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Curvy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Jumpsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Good American Fit for Success Jumpsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZJSb6vFuWe2d4sYjECDcBnfssz8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/good-american-fit-for-success-jumpsuit-eae688ca5e2e4b8fa0c614e6a6189cce.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The denim is quite structured with a touch of stretch.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> There’s sometimes a pesky dye bleed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Good American knows a thing or two about curvy clothing. And this jumpsuit from the brand — dubbed a fitted one-piece that “is as powerful as it looks — is no different than the other designs in the line created by Khloe Kardashian and Emma Grede, meaning, of course, that the quality and fit is impeccable. Sometimes, a drapey fabric such as tencel is more forgiving. At the same time, denim gets the bad rep of being hard to execute, given the material’s stiffness. This denim one-piece, however, has an incredible amount of stretch that clings comfortably to the body, all while hugging your curves. We especially love the two snap closures for the waist to cinch, which adds even more shape to this curve-enhancing ‘suit. There’s even an elongating high waist paired with a skinny ankle that hits right at the knee — ideal for shorties searching for a jumpsuit that doesn’t overwhelm the body. It’s an impressive design altogether, one that has an ultra-cool utilitarian vibe, with hidden zipper closures and wide pant pockets. Available in sizes XS-5XL, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Tinsaye Berhanu</a> (who’s five-foot-two) recs the brand for its range of sizes and how easy it is to style casually and formally.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-5XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>6 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton, elastane | <strong>Inseam: </strong>28-inch</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-formal-rivet-utility-cropped-taffeta-jumpsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Formal</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rivet Utility Cropped Taffeta Jumpsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Saks Fifth Avenue Rivet Utility Cropped Taffeta Jumpsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bdWgfJL0iJIyW4xHBEv6lsI2XoI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Rivet-Utility-Cropped-Taffeta-Jumpsuit-7cd33f3b13c94abbba85388207c9d218.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Fifth Avenue</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>How weightless the material feels.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s tight on those with wider hips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rivet Utility is a spirited LA-based label that merges sportswear, workwear, and fashion — and those things blend as seamlessly as their fabrics do. Plus, they offer plenty of petite fashion options. That’s why Fashion Stylist Marlene Anzaldua recommends the brand, along with their functionality and ability to be paired with anything, from heeled sandals with ankle straps to canvas tennis shoes. “[Their pieces] are very versatile; they can be dressed up or down for any occasion,” Anzaldua tells InStyle. You can wear their jumpsuits casually or for that big event coming up, and this Explorer Cropped jumpsuit proves that, from its plunging v-neck to its shiny, satin material. It’s playful and luxurious, with a slanted waist and patch pockets on the bodice. As well as having whimsical detailing, it’s also an excellent option for petite, having a 27-inch inseam and a fit that isn’t too tight or too loose, but it might be a bit snug around the hips for anyone with a wider booty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Material</strong>: Polyester | <strong>Inseam: </strong>27-inch</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-work-abercrombie--fitch-af-sloane-jumpsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Work</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Abercrombie & Fitch A&F Sloane Jumpsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch A&amp;amp;F Sloane Jumpsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2d9r__rO4mcL39pIaCjJKtXOJfo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Abercrombie-Fitch-Sloane-Jumpsuit-5870dccb16d540759d5e5fe5bf5ccc37.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Abercrombie & Fitch</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It fits curvy, petite bodies so well.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It runs a bit big.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It would be remiss to talk petites and not mention <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Abercrombie & Fitch</a>, which carries a healthy assortment of extended sizes from curvy and plus-size to petite and tall options. This Sloane jumpsuit by the cult-favorite brand is part classic collared V-neck, part Sloane tailored pant (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>a favorite</a> of InStyle editors), with those extended sizes as well. With a tailored wrap-front bodice and functional belt and pockets, we think this looks great for the office — and is also practical to wear during a busy day — and is an extension of what we love about the Sloane pants. In jumpsuit form, this one-piece is just as functional, just as comfy, and just as beautifully fitted for shorties as the petite sizing of the pants. Though Abercrombie & Fitch has a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>large assortment of rave-worthy pieces</a>, from activewear to formal attire, we think this jumpsuit is such a satisfactory piece because of its ease, which, of course, makes it even better for a workday when you don't know what to wear. If you want to look put-together with low effort, this one's for you.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS-XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Material</strong>: Polyester | <strong>Inseam: </strong>28-inch</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-black-spanx-the-perfect-jumpsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Black</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Jumpsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx The Perfect Jumpsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rgJQesJPT80YSrzQpL7lN5F0mhI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Spanx-The-Perfect-Jumpsuit-b421e27d422f4272817f9c0d59a5f7f7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spanx</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The inclusive sizing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It runs a bit large.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For fans of the LBD, enter the LBJ — the Little Black Jumpsuit from Spanx. While the Spanx label might be known for its undergarments and shapewear, its clothing lines are just as impressive, with this jumpsuit proving that sentiment. Not only is it appropriate for the office and contemporary enough for after-office shenanigans, but it also has all of those elements we love about Spanx’s shaping briefs and leggings: It’s shaping and comfortable, all while remaining stylish. The material is smoothing — equipped with a four-way stretch fabric — and is machine washable, meaning it’s an effortless piece of clothing in more ways than one. Of course, it wouldn’t be Spanx without some core shaping technology, which this longlined onesie features. But don’t worry: it’s a hidden addiction that feels sturdy instead of bulky. Like other Spanx designs, it smooths without overly compressing. Overall, this is a high-quality jumpsuit in a basic color with a timeless design that feels modern and elevated. Our only wish is that it didn’t run on the larger side.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-3XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material</strong>: Double jersey | <strong>Inseam: </strong>31-inch</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-colored-la-peony-the-caroline-jumpsuit-in-fuchsia></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Colored</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>La Peony The Caroline Jumpsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="La Peony The Caroline Jumpsuit in Fuchsia" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Q3HJLdQ9_hPuqevfuL-nQsIAawE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/La-Peony-The-Caroline-Jumpsuit-in-Fuchsia-ca2f90c160cb4312a4ec6e7c292c7621.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>La Peony</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>La Peony is an eco-conscious brand.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The sizing could be more inclusive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This poppy pink jumpsuit from La Peony is nothing short of amazing — literally. It’s a one-piece that includes a secret internal smoothing short to ensure a sleek silhouette, designed with a buttery-soft sustainable stretch fleece. Read: It’s comfy. There’s a roomier fit in the mid-region and a drawstring waist, allowing for breathability, but the design also features tailored front pleats, elevating the look a bit.

Each sustainable design honors Indigenous tradition by creating handwoven, hand-embroidered garments like those typically seen in Mexico. Colorful handwoven accents represent the rich history of Mexico, which is why this one earns our top spot — for both the label’s sustainable dyeing techniques and its fun, bright color. So, if you’re on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Barbie wave this summer</a> (Who isn’t?) and want to look just like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Greta Gerwig</a> in the pink jumpsuit she sported on the set, this is the one for you.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material</strong>: Organic cotton | <strong>Inseam: </strong>26-inch</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-patterned-maeve-printed-portside-jumpsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Patterned</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Maeve Printed Jumpsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Anthropologie Maeve Printed Portside Jumpsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/J_Xff2FYYDyFQJ9oKVXwvWVtoFg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Maeve-Printed-Portside-Jumpsuit-f2b7045cdd4d4f7d9edaf959d4d67b0d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The material is soft and has the right amount of stretch.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The straps run a bit long.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking to live out your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Daisy Jones & the Six</a> fantasy, this jumpsuit from Anthropologie is the right one for you. It’s a vintage-feeling one-piece covered in a mirage of bubblegum pink and red floral patterns. The bodice is buttoned at the front, with a romantic rounded neckline, paired with flared legs that bellow at the bottom. But fear not! These flares don’t overwhelm the body and hit right above the ankle. The design is also made from only-at-Anthro Magic Fabric, an engineered fabric to sculpt as it stretches. This means that while the fabric flatters and fits the body, it doesn’t become uncomfortable or restrictive — one of the most significant selling points of this pattered piece. But, overall, we really appreciate how this is a bold and bright piece without feeling too overdone or campy. Though it’s a maximalist piece, the construction makes it feel refined and cohesive, while the fabric makes it feel comfortable for everyday wear.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00-16 |<strong> Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Material</strong>: Viscose, cotton, elastane | <strong>Inseam: </strong>25-inch</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-travel-athleta-passenger-jumpsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Travel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Athleta Passenger Jumpsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Athleta Passenger Jumpsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rvth497H-nQ2TIXejWausZrdG-c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Athleta-Passenger-Jumpsuit-7a6dff023e3f4b7290ebabb4f8e9213d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Athleta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This jumpsuit is semi-fitted, meaning allll the comfort.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> This one runs a bit large.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The security line is a breeze in this breezy one-piece long romper from the beloved athletic and athleisure wear brand, Athleta. We all know <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>airport outfits</a> are a vital part of packing for a vacation, and this jumpsuit is the ultimate terminal fit. Imagine it now: You’re in the airport sporting this uber-comfy and flowy jumpsuit while rolling your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Béis luggage</a> pre-flight (because, let’s be honest, the two compliment each other like denim and a white tee). Sporting this en route to your next destination is a recipe for relaxation even — before the actual peace begins. That’s because this semi-fitted one-piece skims easily over the body while feeling soft to the touch. It’s available in a neutral navy colorway and comes in three lengths. The petite inseam is 27.5 inches, recommended for those under five-foot-four, and is available in XS-XL. Despite the jumpsuit being shorter, those with petite frames will notice that the jumpsuit’s bottom skims the ankle, not the floor, yet another reason why this piece is ideal for travel.

This jumpsuit from Reformation is all of these things —- and so much more. While you might be familiar with Reformation for its formal and wedding guest attire (perhaps you’ve perused their site for something cocktail hour appropriate), the brand also shines in their closet staples, from denim to white tanks and slip dresses. A linen jumpsuit is no different and should be considered a wardrobe essential because of how easy it can be, just like your favorite tee. While silk jumpsuits or one-pieces with elegant cutouts and necklines may be too much at times, a linen jumpsuit has the versatility that other jumpsuits may not. This one is both lightweight and ultra-comfy, an exceptional balance between shaped and loose, and can be styled in so many ways to make it look more casual or more dressed, making it the perfect balance between fashion and functionality.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>012&nbsp; |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material</strong>: Linen | <strong>Inseam: </strong>N/A</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What To Keep In Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Inseam<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“For a jumpsuit, the proper inseam depends on the silhouette,” San Diego-based Personal Stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Jaquelyn Wahidi</a> tells InStyle. “For a straight-leg jumpsuit, an inseam of 25 or 26 inches is best. For a wide-leg jumpsuit, 26 or 28 inches will work for most petite women.” Wahidi also notes that the wide-leg style usually needs an open-toe heel or a shoe with some height to look flattering. For a cropped jumpsuit, she suggests a 24- or 25-inch inseam but says that it should be cropped just slightly above your ankle. “If it’s too cropped, you will end up looking shorter,” she notes.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Light and medium-weight fabrics like linen, cotton, Tencel, viscose, rayon, and some polyester blends are ideal for jumpsuits,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Jaquelyn Wahidi</a> tells InStyle, noting that jumpsuits are upheld as being stretchy and comfortable, so choosing a fabric that is breathable will maintain the jumpsuit’s reputation of being ultra-cozy.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Occasion</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shopping for a jumpsuit</a>, you'll find plenty of different styles, from casual and playful to elegant and sophisticated.

For this, Wahidi suggests deep v-necks, scoop necks, and dark, solid colors. “Vertical stripes can also look good as long as the pattern is subtle. You don't want it to overwhelm your petite frame,” she adds. She also advises shoppers to pay close attention to the waistline of a jumpsuit, mentioning that it should “sit a bit higher than your natural waist.” This will give you the illusion of longer legs, and an overall elongated figure.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Philadelphia-based freelance writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Morgan Sullivan</a> has written for multiple publications, including Cosmopolitan, Teen Vogue, and Glamour, focusing mainly on beauty and fashion.
