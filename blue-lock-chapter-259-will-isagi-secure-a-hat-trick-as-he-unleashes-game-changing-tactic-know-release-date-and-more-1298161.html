Fans can access Blue Lock Chapter 259 on Kodansha's K manga website. However, access to the platform is limited to the United States. While the website offers some free chapters, they are considerably behind the latest releases, with only 43 chapters available for free as of now.

With Noa emphasizing that the team's strategies are most effective when focused on Isagi, the upcoming chapter is likely to place Isagi firmly in the spotlight.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>One potential tactic fans might witness is the implementation of the 'False-9' strategy, facilitated by Kurona's presence as a sideback. This approach involves an attacking player assuming defensive responsibilities, granting them a broader perspective of the game and greater freedom on the field. As the tactics now revolve around him, Isagi could seize the opportunity to pursue a hat-trick, as hinted at in the preceding chapter.</p><p>Blue Lock Chapter 259 will also include a color panel to celebrate the launch of its spin-off film, Blue Lock: Episode Nagi, and will be 22 pages long.</p><p><img alt="Blue Lock [Muneyuki Kaneshiro, Eight Bit, Kodansha, Crunchyroll, Netflix]" title="Blue Lock [Muneyuki Kaneshiro, Eight Bit, Kodansha, Crunchyroll, Netflix]" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-04/1713792398_blue-lock-1.jpg></p><h2 id=6626744d7ccce><strong>Blue Lock Chapter 258 recap</strong></h2><p>Titled Combine • Invent • New Weapon, Blue Lock Chapter 258 started with the aftermath of Isagi's spectacular Two-gun Volley goal. Celebrations erupted among the Bastard Munchen team from the goal. Hiyori is awestruck by the goal and demands an explanation from Isagi, who reveals that the shot wasn't premeditated. Rather, he had intended to mimic Nagi's juggling shot and improvised his own variation in the heat of the moment.</p><p>Despite the goal's impromptu nature, it signifies the addition of the Two-Gun Direct volley to Isagi's repertoire of skills, alongside his meta-vision. With the team's tactics now revolving around Isagi, changes are seen as Kurona replaces Grim on the field, a decision confirmed by Bastard Munchen's coach, Noel Noa.</p><p>Noa emphasizes that Kurona's inclusion will further enhance the team's focus on Isagi-centered tactics, potentially rendering the previous Kaiser-centered strategies obsolete in Blue Lock Chapter 258. The only player left to support Kaiser now is Ness. Furthermore, Noa suggests that if Isagi manages to score one more goal, he could establish himself as superior to Kaiser. If Isagi achieves a hat-trick (scoring three goals in a single match), he could potentially surpass Rin, currently the highest-rated player in the Neo-Egoist League.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Blue Lock Chapter 258 sets up a prelude to the intense battle that will take place between Isagi and Kaiser, with Isagi's newfound prowess posing a significant threat to Paris X Gen's defense.</p><p>For more updates on the match between Paris X Gen and Bastard Munchen in the Blue Lock manga, keep an eye on Pinkvilla.</p><p>*The release dates and time provided are accurate at the time of writing and are subject to change at the discretion of circumstances and creators.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a7qrnEaJmlrZViubCvymaaoZmgqbKzeZFucGavmaG5brXSmp6iZaOasLa%2BxGaYZqCRqXq1vsicomaZo2K1pnnUp6OemaOdsrR5xpqknmWTna6vs8innmaskZjBqq%2BMpKWor12nsq2xwKycZpyRqbJurc2dZKanopp6cn6YcWhvaQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
