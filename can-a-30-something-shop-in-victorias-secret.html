Girls who opt for style over comfort, who like a fruity floral fragrance and&nbsp;watches the Kardashians on repeat. The Victoria’s Secret girl - who I have in my head - would happily send a photo of herself in (matching) underwear to a guy she met the night before. She’s the type of girl who’d get on without even needing a second audition, and she definitely doesn’t do Spanx. In fact, she only knows about ugly big pants because they were in , a movie she watched once when she was “little”.</p><p id=eY_0sx1CuMN0 data-wc=84>The 20-something Victoria’s Secret shopper I have in my head is quite similar to the model we see strut her stuff on the catwalk. One who can eat pizza without putting on a pound - yep, not only is she graced with a 32DD chest, she also has a fast metabolism and a hint of abs, even though she “doesn’t really go to the gym much”. She also definitely has dimples and gets told that she looks a little bit like <a class=hm-link href=#>Kendall Jenner</a>. Only prettier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/edc228c53128-vs-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ec31iH-1dnrr data-wc=12><strong>Alessandra Ambrosia leading the angels at the Victoria's Secret fashion show 2017</strong></p><p id=eEtPkGrIY4pt data-wc=114>Me? This girl I’m describing is a world away from who I am. Sure, I’ve been in the shop - hell, I’ve even been to the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show - but have I ever bought anything? Have I ever left with a huge pink striped bag I spent my hard earned cash on? No. I don’t know why; maybe it’s the overly sweet scent, the staff member at every turn, the huge photos on the wall of VS models giving their best femme fatale poses, or maybe it’s because I think I’m too old. I leave and head straight to a safe space with 100% cotton. Somewhere without leopard print stairs and chandeliers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2359e9ab6702-leanne-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eEFpJk00M-qC data-wc=12><strong>Leanne ready to take on her shopping challenge in the 'Angel suite'</strong></p><p id=e4R4pgkdLM9D data-wc=56>But I decided to give Victoria’s Secret a whirl. Would I be able to find anything for me? Someone who, quite frankly, doesn’t get that excited about lingerie. Don’t worry, you won’t be seeing any pictures of me in my undies (phew!) but be assured, I’m nothing like the Kendall lookalike I have in my brain.</p><p id=e2F3Vs8c4IOK data-wc=96>I started first in the <a class=hm-link href=#>pyjamas</a> section... of course I did. I mean, I love PJs. I definitely have more loungewear than I do going out clothes so this seems like the perfect place to start (and ease myself in gently). I obviously tried on the signature pair; the candy stripe. You will have seen these on Instagram - they’re a huge seller for the brand and I can understand why. They feel lovely, fit really nicely, and come in lots of nice grown up prints. I half expected unicorns, but I really enjoyed the stylish designs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5e95e87768be-pjs-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ehQH4G-8s0eX data-wc=10><strong>Silky and gorgeous, the Victoria's Secret pyjamas were a winner</strong></p><p id=eRqX75eqR4wu data-wc=64>On the subject of PJs, I almost went for a cool little <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>romper PJ outfit</a> - thinking it would be great for a summer holiday. It was very cute, but then I asked myself: “What if I need the loo in the middle of the night?” I realised then, the 20-something would never ask themselves that, and I moved swiftly along. I wish I’d bought it, though.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2337e45dbc62-romper-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ez2Fj3oTX8vh data-wc=10><strong>Romper for bed, anyone? VS has you covered (sort of)&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=exZqwHsHokoB data-wc=136>Next up, I decided the best thing would be to get a little insight into the brand and speak to a member of staff. I don’t know how many people are employed at Victoria’s Secret, but they’re everywhere, all eager to help with walkie talkies, ready to get whatever your heart desires. Autumn - yes, of course her name is Autumn - came to my rescue. With a lovely smile, and a really relaxed manner - she spoke to me like we were best friends. We started with a bra fitting in the Angel Suite (which is so luxurious by the way) and then she told me all about the vast bra designs Victoria’s Secret has. She was so knowledgeable I ended up buying the most perfect strapless bra - and who'd have thought that exists?!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3c505e6b741b-bra-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e6v2fm-wYmXw data-wc=13><strong>The new Summer Angel bra is getting lots of love in online reviews</strong></p><p id=eAmZMjfiEw7j data-wc=137>I also tried the newest release, the new <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Summer Angel Bra</a>. The strapline for this lightweight bra (honestly, it’s light as a feather!) is ‘Comfortable. Sexy. Confident.’ This is definitely right up my street (what?!? I like comfort!), and a quick look at the comments online, I’m not alone. One user reviewed it, writing: “Why did I wait so long to give Victoria’s Secret bras a try! All these years I have thought that VS bras were only for young women trying to look sexy. For over fifty years I have purchased department store bras, thinking they would be best for me, but recently, I decided to give the perfect coverage bra a try. What a wonderful decision! It is absolutely the best fitting, most comfortable bra I have ever purchased! I bought three and will definitely be back.”</p><p id=erRdQ3HYV39E data-wc=3>High praise indeed.</p><p id=eH3UycUlQr-g data-wc=71>Next up: Did you know you can buy clothes at Victoria’s Secret? I certainly didn’t. I was pleasantly surprised to see a super cool leopard print skirt, a silver satin camisole, a <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>nautical striped ruffle top</a> and a polka dot dress. In fact, fashion star Rosie Fortescue has stepped out in this very piece. The prices aren’t cheap, but it looks very chic on and a direction I think the big bosses should continue with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b4a1b1619fed-cami-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e0Gkw6m8xJ2Kc data-wc=4><strong>A chic camisole top&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eot7XwBwueLoF><strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4bc9b63ae285-dress-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eptG1kSWZRQfe data-wc=15><strong>This would look great over jeans and a cami, or on the beach over swimwear</strong></p><p id=e9E5FUX3ug7V6><strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/36a6a5de864d-top-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eaiG4hT2Xd18p data-wc=13><strong>Ruffle top of dreams - perfect to team with a pair of jeans</strong></p><p id=e73pNFqzpeBi1 data-wc=57>I don’t know what it is about Victoria’s Secret but there’s something about it that makes you want to book a gym class, even though I barely even run for the bus. But to do that I needed some chic sportswear. I decided to venture to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Victoria&nbsp;Sport</a> and I couldn’t get over how much I wanted to buy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c9f39d3b0891-vest-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=erJchR8ySo0VO data-wc=5><strong>"I sweat glitter" sports vest</strong></p><p id=ePmny6R67nkqz data-wc=86>Sure, there are a lot of crop tops and cut-out tops for 20-somethings with zero percent fat, but there are also matching workout sets in gorgeous colour ways. There are zip-up hoodies in luxe fabrics - perfect for when you’re at home with Netflix on, while chomping away on a Snickers. And there’s a vast array of leggings. In fact, the Total Knockout Tight has some crazy technology that makes them fast-drying (for girls who really like to work up a sweat) and they’re super comfortable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3ac7603ffcfa-fitness-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eQPWDPbu2xaDo data-wc=11><strong>This is the perfect tracksuit, which just a touch of glitter</strong></p><p id=eEOyfvd9BuPyy data-wc=63>I’ve already mentioned the sweet floral scent which wafts around the shop, but before I left the shop, I decided to see if there was something more fitting for a 35-year-old who likes a grown-up scent. I tried <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Angel Stories Lights Off eau de parfum</a>, and was pleasantly surprised. While it's quite expensive (£59.06),&nbsp;with notes of liquid amber and white patchouli, this isn’t a scent to scoff at.</p><p id=ek9wdSDoTm70W data-wc=61>So can a 30-something really shop in Victoria’s Secret? Yes, 100%. Granted, I’ll be leaving the PINK collection to the youngsters (too much neon hues and slogans for me) and as much as I’d love to parade around my flat in a silky robe, I might stick with my towelling dressing gown. As for the rest, you bet I’m heading back.</p><p id=eyl2_UM-WxByY data-wc=21></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
