According to Karim, the two met at a park in New York City and continued to see each other there before he eventually took down her number. She said he refused to reveal his last name and told her not to Google him -- simply telling her he worked with, managed and traveled with celebrities.</p><p>After she did look him up, she allegedly confronted him about being married. Karim told GMA she tried to break off her relationship with Lentz numerous times, but he kept coming back for more. She claimed their affair was discovered by his wife -- saying, "He called me at midnight and he said ... 'My wife find out. And I gotta go. She saw the text messages.' I was devastated."</p><p>"Woman to woman, I don't think she deserved to be hurt the way that she did," she said. "I never meant to hurt her."</p><p>While Lentz admitted to having an affair, he never disclosed or confirmed the other woman's identity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3Jmam1fmK6zuIylnKesqmK1qrjLrKann12stqexjKmpmqGjmsButMimZJqepJq%2Fbq3Fn5iiql2osKK6w5qjaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
