His neighbor, 36-year-old Joe Junio, was arrested at the scene; she was later charged with open murder, attempted murder, and two counts of child abuse and/or neglect involving a deadly weapon.</p><p>In a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Sarah Davi (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>FOX5</strong></a>) against the woman charged with her husband's murder, she revealed what allegedly led up to the shooting -- which the victim's children, 12 and 15, saw unfold and even filmed on their cellphones as it happened. The filing included a screengrab of one of the videos, showing the moment before he was shot (above).</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f5e54772-e400-460a-bb9e-ea467125d172 data-container-ref=toofab:article:59cb5b26-8747-48e8-82be-943f10cd2fd2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7f/5by4/2024/01/22/7f52da6e26c6458d899aaaf73fe5ef88_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Gulfport Police Department</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Woman Charged with Son's Murder After Cops Find His Body In Box Behind 'False Wall'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>According to the suit, (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>8NewsNow</strong></a>) the family was getting into their car outside their townhouse in a gated community when Junio drove past, before parking next to them. It was at that point one of the children started to record the confrontation, per the filing.</p><p>Someone then allegedly asked Junio, "Why don't you leave us alone? We've had enough. What's your problem with us," before the pastor walked toward Junio's car. It was then, according to the court docs, she got out and started to shoot at the family, hitting both Nick and Davi, before Junio ran to her home.</p><p>The suit alleges the confrontation stemmed from the Davi family reporting Junio to their HOA over violations involving chickens and dogs. The lawsuit claims Junio showed "escalating threatening behavior" after being reported, some of which caused the family to call the police on her twice in the month before the deadly shooting.</p><p>Junio is still being held at the Clark County Detention Center on $300,000 bail; her next court appearance will be March 4.</p><p>"He touched the lives of countless people in his short time with us. We are all shocked and saddened by this senseless tragedy," wrote one of Davi's relatives in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>GoFundMe</strong></a> set up for his surviving family members.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0cb47cba-6c3c-4d4b-a2df-844c0a19ee1f data-container-ref=toofab:article:59cb5b26-8747-48e8-82be-943f10cd2fd2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/85/5by4/2024/01/24/85acfe258e1c4ff09c607b0cfe1db337_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">San Francisco Police Department</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Pair Convicted for Gruesome Murder of Man They Tortured, Injected with Fentanyl and Stuffed In Suitcase</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pma21fmLWquMOrnKdlopqwsL7DoqWgZZGoerGt0q2mq2WUlrFut8ilo56cXZfGbrrEop6hmp%2BnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
