It’s an herb that’s been utilized for a long, long time now, but has only recently gained traction. A lot of this has to do with the fact that the ingredient works wonders at soothing irritation. However, you can also attribute it to the multitude of TikTokers who have used popular cica creams to reduce <a href=# id=auto-tag_redness data-tag=redness>redness</a> on their faces.</p><p>So, if you’re dealing with either of these skin concerns, you’ve come to the right place. We spoke with board-certified dermatologist <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Dr. Rachel Nazarian</a> to uncover exactly what cica is and does, as well as how cica creams can be beneficial to incorporate into your skincare routine. And if you’re unsure of which formulas to start with, don’t even sweat it. Dr. Nazarian also shares five of the best cica creams on the market.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><h2 id=what-is-cica-cream>What is cica cream?</h2><p>I’ve personally furrowed my brows over the difference between cica and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Centella Asiatica</a>, but guess what? There is no difference between the two. “Cica is actually short for Centella Asiatica, a plant that has been used for thousands of years to calm <a href=#>irritated skin</a> and help in wound care,” according to Dr. Nazarian. You might also hear people refer to cica as gotu kola or tiger grass.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=what-are-the-benefits-of-cica-cream>What are the benefits of cica cream?</h2><p>Besides its most commonly-known benefits of soothing <a href=#>sensitive skin</a> and minimizing <a href=#>redness</a>, antioxidant-rich cica additionally preserves skin health and combats free-radical damage, per Dr. Nazarian. “This ability is what stamps cica as a useful tool in anti-aging regimens—and what I personally call a ‘no-brainer’ decision in adding it to products,” she explains.</p><p>You’ll often spot the herb in creams and lotions that are designed for daily use. It’s a multifunctional ingredient that can assist with everything from wrinkles and pimples to skin tone and <a href=#>irritation</a>, according to Dr. Nazarian.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=is-cica-cream-a-moisturizer>Is cica cream a moisturizer?</h2><p>Cica, the ingredient, can be incorporated into just about any type of skincare product. However, you’ll frequently spot it in creams and lotions. Dr. Nazarian notes that cica creams and ointments can be used in lieu of a <a href=#>moisturizer</a>.</p><h2 id=what-should-you-use-cica-cream-for>What should you use cica cream for?</h2><p>Of course, you’re going to want to try cica if you have irritated or <a href=#>sensitive skin</a>. However, our expert also recommends applying a cica cream if you have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>acne-prone skin</a>, the reason being that it’s antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and wound-healing. Slather on a cica cream and then stick on some <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>pimple patches</a> to target blemishes. Dr. Nazarian suggests <a href=# rel=nofollow>Proactiv’s Zits Happen Patches</a> to speed up the healing process and reduce <a href=#>redness</a>.</p><h2 id=which-ingredients-work-well-with-cica>Which ingredients work well with cica?</h2><ul><li><strong>Retinoids:</strong> “Extracts of Centella stimulate collagen synthesis, and I often recommend using these products at night, when skin is in repair mode, combining it with other antiaging pathways, such as <a href=#>retinoids</a>,” our expert explains. Cica and retinoids also suit each other well because of the herb’s anti-inflammatory properties. <a href=#>Retinoids</a> are known for their potential to irritate the skin, so let calming cica come to the rescue.</li><li><strong>Hyaluronic acid: </strong>Dr. Nazarian says <a href=#>hyaluronic acid</a> and cica are a match made in heaven, especially as part of your morning skincare routine. That’s because HA can pull in hydration while cica encourages natural hydration and supports the skin barrier. As always, remember to top everything off with <a href=#>sunscreen</a>.</li></ul><h2 id=when-should-you-apply-cica-cream>When should you apply cica cream?</h2><p>Dr. Nazarian advises using a cica cream one to two times daily.</p><p>If you, too, are in awe of cica’s benefits and can’t wait to get your hands on a cica cream, keep reading for the five best cica creams to <a href=# id=auto-tag_shop data-tag=shop>shop</a> now, according to our dermatologist expert.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/la-roche-posay-cicaplast-balm-b5-target.jpeg><p>You might recognize <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>La Roche-Posay’s Cicaplast Balm B5</a> because it went viral online. TikTok personally made me buy this product when extremely dry, rough patches showed up on my face. This multitasking body, face and hand cica cream helped soothe those areas. “This is a simple way to improve skin and protect it from further damage,” says Dr. Nazarian.

She also notes that when using a jarred skincare product, remember to wash your hands before dipping your fingers into the product.

Not to mention, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Centella Sensitive Cica-Cream</a> is non-comedogenic, meaning it excludes any ingredients that have the potential to clog your pores (special shoutout to those with oily and/or acne-prone skin!).
