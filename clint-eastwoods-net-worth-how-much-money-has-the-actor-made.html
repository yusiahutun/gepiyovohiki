See His Impressive Net Worth</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-03-30</div><p>As one of Hollywood’s most notable actors, <a href=#><strong>Clint Eastwood</strong></a> has pocketed a large amount of money throughout his decades-long career. Between roles in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Gran Torino and Dirty Harry, the film icon has earned a massive net worth. <strong>Scroll below to see how much money he makes from his work in Hollywood.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>What Is Clint Eastwood’s Net Worth?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Clint has an estimated net worth of $375 million, per <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Though he established one of the most sought-after careers in show business, the beloved actor didn’t actually come from fame and fortune. The San Francisco-born star first pursued a career in acting when he moved to Los Angeles in the early 1950s. Prior to acting, Clint lived in Piedmont, California, with his steelworker father and his factory worker mother.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clint-eastwood-net-worth03.jpg><p>After <a href=#>marrying</a> his <a href=#>first wife, <strong>Maggie Johnson</strong></a>, in 1953, Clint was introduced to director <strong>Arthur Libin</strong>, who eventually got him his first role in the 1955 film Revenge of the Creature. After starring in a few old Hollywood movies, Clint landed his first major role in the 1956 western comedy The First Traveling Saleslady. It wasn’t until he was cast in the 1959 television series Rawhide that his career really took off.</p><p>Following his role as Rowdy Yates on the TV show’s six seasons, Clint became known as a hero in western TV. He eventually was cast in 1964 as the “Man With No Name” in the A Fistful of Dollars trilogy during the 1960s. He also starred in Hang Em High, Paint Your Wagon and Two Mules for Sister Sara. In 1971, the award winner landed his second iconic role in the hit blockbuster Dirty Harry.</p><p>Besides acting, the <a href=#>dad of eight</a> has established a very successful career when it comes to directing and producing. In 1971, the hunk made his directorial debut with Play Misty for Me. Although the film didn’t receive the best reviews, Clint’s choice to direct was clearly a good one considering he would eventually direct more than act throughout the rest of his career.</p><p>If Clint’s net worth didn’t prove his all-star status in Hollywood, then his massive list of awards and accolades should be enough to settle the score. Not only has he received multiple nominations for his work in films Unforgiven, Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby, among many others, but he’s also taken home <a href=#>Academy Awards</a>, Directors Guild of America Awards and <a href=#>Golden Globe Awards</a> for his work in acting, directing and producing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clint-eastwood-net-worth04.jpg><h2><strong>What Has Clint Eastwood Said About Retiring?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Although fans have expected him to slow down in his 90s, the Richard Jewell director’s daughter, <a href=#><strong>Alison Eastwood</strong></a>, exclusively told Closer that she doesn’t expect her dad to retire. “I think he just wants to work and enjoy his life,” she said.</p><p>Clint, himself, proved he has no intentions of cutting back on his Hollywood work as he made his return to the big screen in 2021 for the first time in three years in his flick Cry Macho. The western drama, which happens to be Clint’s 39th film as a director, is set in 1979 and tells the story of his washed-up horse breeder character and a one-time rodeo star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46co6KmpGKyor%2FTsKaonKNiu6bAjLCmq6yYYrWww4ymrJygXaK8r7HYZp%2Baq12ptaZ5wJyrqKpdoq6lsY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
