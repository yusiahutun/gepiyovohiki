However, we're pleased to say that he died peacefully, in good spirits and with his family around him. He was 86.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dad was a talented comedy writer and comedian in a particularly golden vintage. Incidentally, he never really liked the terms 'comedy writer' or 'comedian', instead preferring 'hack' and 'entertainer'&nbsp; and always thought the term 'national treasure' meant he'd just been dup up.&nbsp; He was, in his words, arrogant in his humility.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He had a gift for friendship (as anyone who still has a landline will testify) and a genius for putting people at their ease. Oy yes, and he made many people laugh. A lot. Over many years.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Baz was, firstly a loving husband to Terry for nearly sixty years and a gentle father to Tony, David, Jack, Bob. He was a friend to their partners, Jayne, Matt, Garry and Suzannah. As a grandfather, Ruby, Tom, Evan, Archie, Hope, Martha and Connie all loved him and more recently, Ruby's daughter Isobel, had the good fortune to spend time with him as a great grandfather.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The family want to place on record our thanks to the doctors, nurses and consultants on Crick and Gaskill Wards for the compassion, dedication, skill and respect they showed to him at Northwick Park. We'd also like to acknowledge the care taken by Dr Denton and Liam and Nisan at MacMillan for their comforting words and guidance. It'll be no surprise to those who knew and worked with him that he was telling an Archbishop of Canterbury joke to a nurse not long before he died. That was one of his gifts, making strangers feel welcome, making them laugh.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He leaves behind him a life of fun, joy, love and silliness, and we'll be doing the best to maintain that legacy.</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_3 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meanwhile BBC Director General Tim Davie also paid tribute to Cryer. He said in a statement: 'Barry Cryer was a uniquely funny, talented and generous person.

An incredibly funny man who worked with - and wrote for - the giants of comedy.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Yet he remained forever curious and delighted by whatever was fresh and original.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Kind, encouraging, generous and a one off.
