I thought, ‘What am I waiting for?’” she said in a recent interview with <a href=#>Good Housekeeping</a>. “Motherhood has been the greatest gift of my life. I have a friend who is very active with orphanages in Ethiopia, and he had just come back from a trip where he had been spending time with the orphans.”</p><p>“I was incredibly compelled by the light around them, even though they were living in extreme poverty without parents,” Britton continued. “Some of them had AIDS. It made me want to go to Ethiopia and to see how I could help. Right now, I’ve got one kid and there’s one of me, and if I find a man who wants to have another child, I’d love to do it. I might do it as a single mom, too.”</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>We're so happy to have the lovely @conniebritton, @rashidajones, and @traceeellisross on our new #MayIssue! 🌺🌸💄Make sure to get your copy! #thatsgoodhousekeeping (📸: @brianbowensmith)</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Good Housekeeping</a> (@goodhousekeeping) on Apr 11, 2017 at 8:54am PDT</p><p>MUST-SEE: Kate Middleton Makes Brutal Confession About Motherhood</p><p>Britton is not only a proud single mother, but a woman who confidently embraces her figure.
