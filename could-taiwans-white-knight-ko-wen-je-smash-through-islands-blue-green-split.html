Washington is Taipei’s biggest backer, and although it does not officially recognise it as independent, it is legally bound to help it defend itself from military attack.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ko said he had spent six days in Washington during his visit to the US,“having close and thorough exchanges” of views with politicians, including the Republican former secretary of state Mike Pompeo and Democrat congressmen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Through mutual trust and sincere dialogues … I have a clearer picture of the prospects and challenges Taiwan is facing and I will continue to carry on with my pragmatic approach to win recognition from voters,” he wrote in a Facebook post on April 27.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said he would do all he could to reduce the long-time “political divide and ideological differences” on the island and to strive for the “internationalisation and normalisation of Taiwan”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0

trade negotiations should be updated ‘soon’, Biden official says</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The former doctor started as an informal ally of the DPP when he ran as an independent for mayor in 2014, but part of his campaign platform focused on ending the political divide in Taiwan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If elected, I won’t join any political party,” he said in a campaign debate during the 2014 Taipei mayoral race.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He argued that Taiwan’s biggest problem was the nonstop political fight between the independence-leaning “green” and mainland-friendly “blue” camps and such ideological confrontation was disadvantageous to the long-term development of the island.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After he was elected mayor, Ko gradually distanced himself from the DPP but managed to win his second four-year term in 2018 through the support of voters who dislike the ideological struggles between the KMT and the DPP.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Based on such support, he founded the Taiwan People’s Party a year later as a “white force” that stands between the green and blue sides.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0"

security</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As mayor he jointly organised an annual twin-city forum with the Shanghai authorities and visited the Chinese mainland 18 times as mayor.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also repeatedly called for the resumption of cross-strait dialogue to reduce the risk of war across the Taiwan Strait.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since then he has said he accepts the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family, echoing Beijing’s preferred rhetoric and bringing him closer to the KMT’s position.</p>However, unlike the KMT he has never clarified whether he will accept (or reject) the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">so-called 1992 consensus</span></a> – an informal agreement that there is only one China, though the two sides may differ on what that means – which Beijing insists must be the framework for cross-strait relations.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beijing has suspended official exchanges with Taipei since Tsai Ing-wen of the DPP was elected president in 2016 and refused to accept the consensus.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ko’s position is that the consensus now only causes resentment among the Taiwanese people and the mainland authorities should find another formula that the public can accept to restart cross-strait dialogue.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tsai Pi-ru, a former Taiwan People’s Party lawmaker and adviser to Ko, said if the 63-year-old can keep his support rate above 20 per cent in coming months, he would be a genuine threat to both the DPP and KMT.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Until now, the KMT has yet to clearly decide who will run for the party, and its most popular choice Hou Yu-ih is tipped to be challenged by other KMT aspirants, including [Foxconn’s billionaire founder] Terry Gou over his inexperience in cross-strait and foreign policy,” Tsai said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tsai said Hou’s previous comment that Taiwan should not become a “superpower’s pawn” has been used by the DPP and pro-independence camp to attack him for taking a “US-sceptical” stand that might upset Washington, the island’s main international backer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She added that although Lai has been confirmed as the DPP’s candidate, his comments as premier in 2018 that he would be a “pragmatic worker for independence” may worry the Americans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“All these problems could allow Ko to have room for manoeuvre to increase his chances in the race, given that the TPP leader is popular among young and neutral voters,” Tsai added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A March survey by National Chengchi University’s Election Study Centre in Taipei showed that Ko was the most popular politician among young people with a popularity rating of 5.9 out of 10, followed by Hou’s 5.36 points and Lai’s 4.91 points.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His opinion poll rating has remained steady this year and two recent polls have suggested he is within a few points of catching his rivals.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an April 19 survey by Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation he polled at 22.6 per cent compared with 33.4 for Lai and 29.7 per cent for Hou. In a poll last Tuesday by the Taipei-based United Daily News, Ko was on 23 per cent, compared with 29 per cent for Hou and 27 per cent for Lai.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Who will win Taiwan’s crucial 2024 election?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Under the Taiwanese election system, there is no run-off in the presidential vote and the candidate with the most votes will be the outright winner.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Ko should be able to absorb votes from both the KMT and the DPP, especially young voters who do not like the two parties,” said Wu Tzu-chia, head of online media platform My-Formsa.com.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wu said the DPP’s policy of extending the mandatory military service of the island’s conscripts from four months to one year and its attempt to turn the 2024 poll into a “choice between war and peace” – a reference to its usual tactic of portraying a KMT victory as spelling doom for Taiwan – has scared away some young voters.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chan Wei-yuan, a KMT Taipei city councillor, said those who support Ko are disappointed with the performances of both the KMT and the DPP, which would make the third party candidate a spoiler in the race.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/04/10/clean_2.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although Ko and his party have positioned themselves as neither blue nor green in an attempt to appeal to people across the divide, Chan suggested he may be a bigger threat to the KMT by splitting the blue vote.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But as long as the KMT candidate is able to maintain a strong lead ahead of Ko, a split vote within the blue camp could be averted due to the strategic voting effect when voters automatically move their support from their first preferred candidate to another one who has a better chance at winning,” Chan said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyxu8uiq6Kbo2Sus8DInKOeZ2NnfnqCkmpmnKelobFuwMCirpqmo2LEqbXTnmSkppmctbV5yqhksJ2eYremedKmmKygXam1s7vUoJ9moaOhrq%2Bw0maZpa2VYrSzscSnZKyonJ7B</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
