Let's flash back for a second ...
The reality TV star and &#34;Green Mile&#34; actor wed at the Chapel of the Flowers in Las Vegas back on May 20, 2011. At the time, Courtney wore a white mini that showed off A TON of leg."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It was very Vegas:</p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/aa/o/2016/05/24/aa4e891bd9035f83ada870ec5ef94702_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><a href=#><span class=embed-image><span class=icon><span>Launch Gallery</span><span class=caption>More Celebrity Wedding Photos!</span></span></span></a></p><p>To celebrate their 5 year anniversary, the two renewed their vows in front of the Hollywood sign in Los Angeles over the weekend (top). This time, the now-21-year-old sported a more traditional, white mermaid gown. The dress hugged every curve on her body and put her surgically-enhanced chest on full display. She also sported a veil, long blonde hair and a full face of makeup.</p><p>Her other half looked dapper in a black suit.</p><p>"Renewing my vows to the man I love under the Hollywood sign was an honor. The first reason why we chose that location for such a special moment is because Hollywood ultimately brought us together," Stodden exclusively tells toofab. "I wouldn't have even known my hubby if it wasn't for this town!"</p><p>"The second reason is due to the fact that <strong>Daeida 'Ida' Hartell</strong>, 'The Mother of Hollywood,' married <strong>Harvey Henderson Wilcox</strong>, a man over 30 years her senior when she was just a teenager," she continues. "Together, they founded Hollywood and Ida originated its name. We feel a connection to such a power-couple!"</p><p>The ceremony comes after the two announced they're expecting their first child together.</p><p>"It's a bittersweet time for me right now. I'm dealing with a lot of stress and emotions surrounding life and its ups and downs," she said in a statement on May 16. "Doug and I weren't planning on going public with this so soon. I'm only four weeks along in my pregnancy. But some things are out of your control."</p><p>Looks like she's already dealing with morning sickness, as she posted this on Instagram earlier today:</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnd7j25ma2xfmLy2vtOnnLJlo6m8pbDEp2Sdp6WceqnB05yfoqufo3q3u9ZmqZ6mlayurXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
