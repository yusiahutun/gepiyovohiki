It's packed full of amazing games, like Animal Crossing: New Horizons and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p><p>The Switch boasts a nice, clean interface. Which makes it simple to jump into your games or browse applications like the Nintendo eShop or News feed.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The customization options for the Nintendo Switch user interface aren't exhaustive, but there are various ways to manage your game library or change the color scheme. So, in this article, we show you how to customize the Nintendo Switch user interface.</p><h2 id=how-to-change-the-nintendo-switch-color-scheme>How to Change the Nintendo Switch Color Scheme</h2><p>Nintendo has never been big on themes. While Microsoft and Sony embraced customization with their Xbox and PlayStation consoles respectively, offering dynamic themes and wallpapers, Nintendo lagged behind.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The 3DS was different. You could buy and apply themes, many centered around popular Nintendo characters. Unfortunately, its next console the Wii U didn't provide any customization.</p><p>The Switch follows that trend. You can change the Switch color scheme, but you won't be impressed with the choice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/switch-themes.png><p>From the home screen, go to <strong>System Settings</strong> and scroll down to <strong>Themes</strong>. Here you can choose between <strong>Basic White</strong> or <strong>Basic Black</strong>. Choose your color and press <strong>A</strong> to apply. This will change the primary color of the interface across the whole system, including areas like News and Albums.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/switch-change-display-colors.png><p>Within <strong>System Settings</strong>, in the <strong>System</strong> setting, you will also find an option called <strong>Change Display Colors</strong>. Here you can switch between <strong>Default</strong>, <strong>Invert Colors</strong>, and <strong>Greyscale</strong>. Technically, this does change the appearance of the UI. That said, it also changes the appearance of everything else, including your games, so only use the setting if you need it for accessibility reasons.</p><p>Perhaps Nintendo will release more themes in the future. Even some more colors would be welcome! However, the Switch has been out for many years and nothing has come to fruition, so it seems unlikely.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Your best option right now is to <a href=#>buy some new Nintendo Switch controllers</a> to spice up your system's style.</p><h2 id=how-to-organize-your-game-library>How to Organize Your Game Library</h2><p>The games on your home screen are those which you have played or downloaded recently. If you have more than 13, on the far-right you will see an <strong>All Software</strong> button.</p><p>You cannot rearrange the games on the home screen. You can move something to the first position by launching it, but it'll just get unseated if you launch something else afterwards.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/switch-all-software.png><p>However, an update to the Switch now allows you to sort the full library. To do this, go to All Software and press <strong>R</strong> to sort by various options: <strong>Most Recently Played </strong>(those you have never played will be at the bottom), <strong>Longest Play Time</strong> (from longest to shortest), <strong>Title</strong> (from 0 to 9, then A to Z), and <strong>Publisher</strong> (from 0 to 9, then A to Z).</p><p>Hover over the option you wish to sort by, then press <strong>A</strong> to apply. This will permanently apply the change, but you can easily switch back and forth. This option does not rearrange the icons on the Home screen, only on the All Software page.</p><h2 id=how-to-remove-games-from-the-home-screen>How to Remove Games From the Home Screen</h2><p>The Switch doesn't have much internal storage (only 32 GB), and some of that is reserved for the system. That's not going to store many games.</p><p>Handily, you can expand the storage using microSD cards, allowing you to download games to your heart's content.</p><p>However, download enough games and you might find yourself frustrated with the clutter, especially if you've completed a game or don't play it any more. You can clean up the home screen and game library by removing games.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/switch-delete-software.png><p>To do this, highlight the game tile. Press <strong>+</strong> on the right Joy-Con to open the menu. Select <strong>Manage Software > Delete Software > Delete</strong>.</p><p>Removing games deletes the files from your console, but it doesn't revert your purchase. It will also keep your save data, so you won't lose any of your progress. This is great if you want to temporarily remove the game if you haven't finished with it and want to return to it later.</p><p>You can still download the games again at no cost from the eShop. To do this, open the eShop, select your <strong>profile icon</strong> in the top-right, and go to <strong>Redownload</strong>.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-custom-themes-with-homebrew>How to Get Custom Themes With Homebrew</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/custom-switch-theme.png><p>Where Nintendo falls down, the homebrew scene step up. This is referred to as "hacking" your Switch and installing custom firmware. It's nothing new---you can <a href=#>hack your Wii U to make it more useful</a>.</p><p>Installing custom firmware is not illegal, but it does void your warranty. Nintendo frowns upon it and you will be banned if you go online with a custom firmware Switch.</p><p>As such, only proceed if you are confident in what you are doing and understand the consequences. Mess up and you risk bricking your device, which means it will become unusable. This is very rare, but there is a risk. If you don't feel up to it, be patient and hope that Nintendo patches official support for themes in the future.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Until then, you will need firmware like Atmosphere, ReiNX, or SX OS. Use the <a href=#>NH Switch Guide</a> to find out how to install custom firmware on your Switch. If you follow the guidelines, you should not lose any of your data. Your games, save data, and Nintendo account integration should all remain intact.</p><p>Once done, launch the NXThemes Installer. You can then use the store within to browse for themes, or look on the <a href=#>NXThemes subreddit</a>.</p><p>Some of the best examples include a <a href=#>New Horizons theme</a> and a <a href=#>Persona 5 theme</a>. Instructions on how to manually install the themes can be found on the <a href=#>NH Switch Guide Theming page</a>.</p><h2 id=now-sit-back-and-play-the-best-switch-games>Now, Sit Back and Play the Best Switch Games</h2><p>These are all the ways that you can adjust <a class=no-callout href=#>the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite's</a> user interface right now. Hopefully Nintendo will update the system in the future to allow for more customization, as it did with the 3DS.</p><p>With your Switch looking the way you want it to, it's time to play some games. And thankfully, we have compiled a list of <a href=#>the best Nintendo Switch games you can buy today</a>.
