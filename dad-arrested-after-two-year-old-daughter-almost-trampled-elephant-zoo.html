A father was arrested at San Diego Zoo on Friday after he almost got himself and his daughter trampled to death by an elephant.
Witnesses claim Jose Manuel Navarrete carried his two-year-old into the habitat in an attempt to get a photo, when the animal suddenly charged at them.
Incredible footage of their narrow escape, obtained by KFMB-TV, show the pair inside the paddock around 4 PM, the father holding the little girl in his arms, with their backs turned to the massive mammal."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"It looked to me like it was a mock charge, which is really intended to scare off an intruder."</p><p>"However, if Chaba thought her message wasn't getting through, it could've turned into a more serious attack."</p><p>“It was incredibly dangerous for the father and child, and I think they were both just very, very lucky. Oftentimes, the public thinks of elephants just like Disney’s Dumbo where they can pet them and ride them, and that's not the case. Wild animals are unpredictable," she added. "If someone thinks that they're going to take a chance, you know, for a thrill, try to do something like this, and do a selfie with a wild animal, you know you can end up losing your life."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ea4ec1ae-07b0-47c3-ba2a-47001c6156d8 data-container-ref=toofab:article:b798a571-2e0c-4515-bb24-3bd30b9470ca data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ca/5by4/2021/03/19/cab016d1ebb34979a8a32e8a609a3981_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Caring Hands Animal Hospital</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Medical Director of Caring Hands Animal Hospital Charged With Bestiality</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j2xma2pfma6lecCrqZ6rpJqxbq3FrZyrZaSsvG7FxJqpZqecmXqlrdSgn62domKurbnOrKtmrKKWurG4xJ1knqSVpbWiutNmsainXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
