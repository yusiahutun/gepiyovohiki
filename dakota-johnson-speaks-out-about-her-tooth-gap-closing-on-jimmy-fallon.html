Really. The stunning actress is known for her long, sleek brunette locks, eye-skimming fringe and that sexy <a class=hm-link href=#>Madonna</a>-esque gap between her two front upper teeth. Admittedly, the world is divided on the allure of an adult tooth gap but love them or hate them, they're certainly distinctive.</p><p id=eOO2yreTLkpa data-wc=45>So no surprise then that some of Dakota's fans were up in arms when her gap disappeared recently, with many assuming the star had undergone orthodontic work.

Dakota arrived in the coolest <a class=hm-link href=#>oriental-print little black dress</a> with matching heels, a chic up-do and - SHOCK HORROR - a missing gap. Fans posted on Twitter: "This is the saddest I've ever been. RIP Dakota Johnson's tooth gap."

I had a permanent retainer since I was like 13 and it was glued to the back of my teeth. I was having a lot of neck problems recently, so my orthodontist, she decided it was a good idea to take it off and see if my jaw sort of expanded and it helped me, and my gap closed by itself and I'm really sad about it too."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Twitter</a><p id=enz_3xp7L5JX data-wc=56>She continued, giggling, "Anyway, hold on, this is really important. I'm really sad about my gap tooth too, so I'd really appreciate some privacy." Dakota revealed that she now has to deal with a whole new world of problems, such as 'getting food stuck in my tooth.'

Dakota insists the gap is going to come back with other retainers. "The world of dentistry is so advanced," she told Jimmy, saying her neck problems wouldn't return. "We're going to do it in a really holistic kind of way."</p><p id=eSRLuAw6wZUE data-wc=29>So there you have it. Dakota's tooth gap has gone and may return, so fret not.
