In October 2021, she announced she was leaving the network to join GAC Family.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Part of it was because I had the opportunity to do a multi-picture deal, which I hadn’t done at Hallmark, and also not just multi-picture, but also really being a producer, really helping to develop these stories from the beginning,” the </span><i><span>Sidekicks </span></i><span>actress told </span><a href=#><i><span>Us Weekl</span></i><span>y</span></a><span> in July 2022 about her decision. “And that’s really exciting for me as a storyteller.

And I’m trying to teach him the quadratic formula, he hasn’t quite gotten it yet.
