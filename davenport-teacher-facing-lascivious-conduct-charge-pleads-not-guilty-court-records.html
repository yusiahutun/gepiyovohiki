The alleged incident did not take place on school grounds or at a school event. Both the Defendant and the alleged victim were coincidentally guests at a wedding reception at a public park,” court documents say.</p><p>Lira had no authority over the premise or persons in attendance at the reception, other than his own child, court documents say, adding Lira “had no more authority over the alleged victim than did anyone else at the wedding.”</p><p>Lira, documents say, “is unable to prepare a defense because he does not know the alleged factual basis for his being in a position of authority to be charged with this crime.”</p><p>The motion asks the court to direct the Scott County Attorney to provide a “bill of particulars” and asks that if the state fails to provide a sufficient bill of particulars, the charge will be dismissed.</p><p>A bill of particulars is a written itemization of claims in a lawsuit that the defendant may demand of a plaintiff to clarify details of the claims.</p><p>Lira has pleaded not guilty and demands a speedy trial, according to court records. A hearing for the motion is set for Feb. 22 in Scott County Court.</p><p><strong>In October 2023</strong></p><p>Police allege in affidavits that about 8 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 7, an incident occurred at Credit Island Lodge, 2301 W.
