But today its reputation for inclusivity and tolerance <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">is under scrutiny</a> – as are its deep ties to the political establishment and the lack of LGBTQ representation in its films.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Disney’s workers <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">have been staging walkouts</a> in protest at chief executive Bob Chapek’s lacklustre response to Florida legislation dubbed “don’t say gay”. The controversial bill bars instruction on “sexual orientation or gender identity” in schools from kindergarten through grade 3.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Republicans promoting it claim that parents rather than teachers should be talking to their children about gender issues during their early formative years. But their prejudices were laid bare by a tweet from Christina Pushaw, press secretary for Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">that said:</a> “The bill that liberals inaccurately call ‘don’t say gay’ would be more accurately described as an anti-grooming bill.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Just in case anyone did not get the message, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">she added: </a>“If you’re against the anti-grooming bill, you are probably a groomer or at least you don’t denounce the grooming of four- to eight-year-old children.

It has been condemned as “hateful” by Joe Biden and other Democrats who argue that it demonises LGBTQ people.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Wolf, press secretary of the LGBTQ rights organisation Equality Florida and a survivor of the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Pulse nightclub shooting</a> in 2016, says: “The ‘don’t say gay bill’ was dubbed that by the community because it is a bigoted, very specifically anti-LGBTQ piece of legislation designed to censor classroom speech about our community.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>“It is a hateful bill that is rooted in the same anti-LGBTQ animus that has been used to justify discrimination and violence against us forever. It needs to be vetoed and, if it isn’t vetoed, it needs to be repealed.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Few activists or non-government organisations could have opposed the bill with the clout of Disney, as synonymous with Florida as beaches and oranges. The opening of the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Walt Disney World Resort</a> in October 1971 helped transform the state into an economic powerhouse and tourism magnet. Disney is now the biggest private sector employer in Florida; Walt Disney World had more than 75,000 workers before the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Aubrey Jewett,</a> a political science professor at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, says: “You could argue that Disney has had a bigger impact on Florida and central Florida than any other company or group. It just really changed the face of Florida.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>“The state had always been a tourist destination, going back to the 1920s, in the sense that it had warmer weather and coastline. But typically it was mom and pop attractions that popped up to service tourists. When Disney came into town, it really put Florida on the map not only as a national destination for many Americans but an international tourist destination well known all around the world.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Disney has also contributed millions of dollars to Republican and Democratic politicians, ensuring a cosy relationship between Mickey Mouse and state government, Jewett adds: “Disney typically has not gotten involved in lots of controversial social issues. They donate to a lot of charities in central Florida and try to be a good corporate citizen.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>“But they also do try to steer public policy their way like any big corporation and because they are so big and have such influence, usually they’re very successful. Typically almost anything they want they get in terms of public policy.”</p><figure id=0f27a633-3f93-4930-90e3-5557586fafd9 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Bob Chapek.</span> Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>Yet the “don’t say gay” bill wrong-footed Chapek, who succeeded Bob Iger as chief executive in February 2020. Initially he sent a message to Disney workers affirming the company’s support for LGBTQ rights but also contending that corporate statements often do little to change minds and can be “weaponised” by either side.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Chapek then told Disney shareholders that, instead of making an early public statement against the legislation, company officials had been working behind the scenes with politicians “to achieve a better outcome” but without success, despite “our longstanding relationships with those lawmakers”.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>It was tone deaf response, misjudging the mood of an era in which companies face heightened ethical expectations to take a stand on issues such as Black Lives Matter. Disney workers mobilised with an online campaign including a website, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">whereischapek.com</a>, that says their leadership “utterly failed to match the magnitude of the threat to LGBTQIA+ safety represented by this legislation”.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The site includes anonymous employee statements criticising Disney, a schedule of walkouts in protest and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">a detailed breakdown</a> of the company’s donations to Florida politicians, including $106,809.38 to the “Friends of Ron DeSantis” political action committee.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Jewett comments: “If you look at their donation record, they do give to candidates and elected officials of both parties but over the last 20 years they gave a lot more to Republicans because Republicans have been in charge of our state government for the last 20 years.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>“Like any big interest group, they want access and influence, and the best way to get that is to make sure you give to the party and people that are in charge. They give to a lot of Democrats, because they want those Democrats to be on their side too, but they have given a disproportionate amount to Republican legislators, many of whom supported and voted for the ‘don’t say gay’ bill. That’s what’s upset a lot of the employees.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The employee protests will culminate on Tuesday with a general walkout by LGBTQ workers and their supporters at Disney worksites in Florida, California and elsewhere. The Human Rights Campaign has said it will <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">stop accepting money from Disney</a> “until we see them build on their public commitment and work with LGBTQ+ advocates to ensure that dangerous proposals, like Florida’s ‘don’t say gay or trans’ bill, don’t become dangerous laws”.</p><figure id=8ef755d8-f8a3-48c6-bab9-6a64a4b75524 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Jack Whitehall and Emily Blunt in Jungle Cruise.</span> Photograph: Frank Masi/© 2021 Disney Enterprises, Inc. All Rights Reserved</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>How did Chapek get it so wrong? Eric Marcus, creator and host of the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Making Gay History podcast,</a> says: “Disney has cultivated an LGBTQ-friendly image, both through their inclusion of LGBTQ characters in recent years and with their employees, so it’s shocking but not shocking that the CEO would have been so flat-footed. I don’t think he realised, although he should have, how much the world has changed.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Chapek is 61 years old. Marcus, who is 63, adds: “That means that he had zero education about LGBTQ history and so what he knows is what he’s picked up along the way and maybe from his diversity and inclusion team. So I’m guessing a lot of the flat-footedness is out of ignorance and also fear of doing the wrong thing.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Stung by the outcry, Chapek apologised and announced that the company was pausing all political donations in Florida. He told employees: “I truly believe we are an infinitely better and stronger company because of our LGBTQ+ community. I missed the mark in this case but am an ally you can count on – and I will be an outspoken champion for the protections, visibility and opportunity you deserve.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>DeSantis, in typically combative style, responded by sending a campaign fundraising email that said: “Disney is in far too deep with the Communist Party of China and has lost any moral authority to tell you what to do.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Some activists welcome Chapek’s shift as better late than never. Wolf, the Equality Florida spokesperson who finished working at Disney World in 2013, says: “I don’t know much about Mr Chapek at all personally but it speaks volumes that he’s been willing to to meet with cast members and to acknowledge where his statements have fallen short.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>“I certainly think in a very divisive political climate, that’s a challenging thing to do. It also speaks to the need for continued growth around representation in leadership positions in corporate America generally.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The row has erupted when the multibillion-dollar Disney behemoth has never been more powerful. <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Its global franchise</a> spans Marvel superheroes, the Star Wars saga, The Simpsons, National Geographic and Lin-Manuel Miranda, who with films such as Encanto projects an admirably inclusive, progressive, 21st-century vision.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>But Chapek’s <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">memo to staff</a> on 7 March, which cited “diverse stories” such as Black Panther, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and the TV series Modern Family as “more powerful than any tweet or lobbying effort”, implying that Disney’s content speaks for itself, has been questioned.</p><figure id=219d00d9-cab4-4f02-bbbf-148af8e739a4 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Howard Ashman.</span> Photograph: AP</figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>For decades the studio’s output was steadfastly heterosexual even though its creative talents included gay people such as <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Howard Ashman,</a> an Oscar winner who wrote the lyrics for The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast before his death from Aids in 1991.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>There has been some progress since then with a <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">growing LGBTQ portrayals</a> in films and TV shows and the selling of LGBTQ pride-themed merchandise at Disney stores. Last year’s film <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Jungle Cruise</a> featured a prominent gay character:<strong> </strong>McGregor Houghton, played by Jack Whitehall. But the struggle against erasure is far from over.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>In response to the current controversy, LGBTQ staff at Pixar, the animation studio owned by Disney, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">wrote in an open letter:</a> “We at Pixar have personally witnessed beautiful stories, full of diverse characters, come back from Disney corporate reviews shaved down to crumbs of what they once were.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>“Nearly every moment of overtly gay affection is cut at Disney’s behest, regardless of when there is protest from both the creative teams and executive leadership at Pixar. Even if creating LGBTQIA+ content was the answer to fixing the discriminatory legislation in the world, we are being barred from creating it. Beyond the ‘inspiring content’ that we aren’t even allowed to create, we require action.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>None of these recent events come as a surprise to <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Henry Giroux</a>, a distinguished scholar in critical pedagogy at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, and author of The Mouse that Roared: Disney and the End of Innocence.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>He says: “What people really tend to underestimate and confuse is that many of the organisations that define themselves as simply avenues for entertainment are enormously powerful political and what I call pedagogical organisations. They shape identities, they shaped values, they get engaged in defining who is excluded and who isn’t, what people want and what people don’t.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>“The thing about Disney that’s interesting, more so in some ways than other organisations, is it hides behind this veil of innocence while at the same time it utterly commodifies children. It’s one of the top five major corporations that define the entertainment field and beyond all that it exercises enormous influence politically in Florida.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Giroux adds: “Now think about an organisation that basically supports DeSantis. They give money to these people and then they come out and they say, ‘Oh, we’re so sorry, we really are supporting LGBTQ people’. It’s just pure nonsense and is a kind of cover for politics that hides in the shadows.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJ6Zobpwfo9raWilkad8c32OnaCsppWueqetwp6qZpqRmLitrdKhZKWfkqm%2Bbq%2FOp6urp6aav7TFjJ2mp6xdqK66ecaasGaamaG5brLLqKminJE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
