'These relationships can often repeatedly break up and reunite multiple times a week' or month, Brodsky said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>ROCD can also become a self-fulfilling prophecy if the symptoms end up pushing a partner away.</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/femail/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>Do you worry about them being boring, shy or clever enough.
