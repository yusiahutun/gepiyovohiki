Megan, who’s already had to defend her shooting claims from Lanez and others, accused Drake of “using my shooting for clout” and defending one of his “homeboys” <a href=#>in a tweet</a>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Stop using my shooting for clout bitch ass Niggas!

But Ye didn’t take the bars as an attack, <a href=#>tweeting</a> “Love Drake #lovespeech” in response. “Imagine all the rappers on the same side and everyone cleaning up each others contracts,” he wrote, referencing <a href=#>his ongoing plight over his contracts</a> and ownership of his music. Drake didn’t take the opportunity to diss Ye’s recent antisemitic comments, though.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Enough already I done gave this man his flowers multiple times Let’s really see who are real ops are in this music game Imagine all the rappers on the same side and everyone cleaning up each others contracts It’s kingdom time Love Drake <a href=#>#lovespeech</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/egWA2VyV9Y</a></p>— ye (@kanyewest) <a href=#>November 4, 2022</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cla2t5mih004u3h6hyfvgfe1o@published>DRAM</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cla2nqgls001b3h6h4l2glgsm@published data-word-count=121>Remember DRAM (<a href=#>once and formerly Shelley</a>) from that mid-’10s hit “Broccoli”? Drake still does. “Tried to bring the drama to me, he ain’t know how we cha-cha slide,” he raps in the chorus of “BackOutsideBoyz.” That’s a revival of their beef from 2015, when some fans <a href=#>compared Drake’s “Hotline Bling” to DRAM’s “Cha Cha,”</a> which came out months before. DRAM replied with a video message, recorded while he paced circles around his home. “Somebody tell Drake to shut the fuck up about that shit, man,” he said, claiming the drama was from five years ago and that all Drake’s smoke was actually from his bodyguards. “Why don’t you bring up how&nbsp;you got smacked by Diddy&nbsp;or some shit?” DRAM added. <a href=#>We will.</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Woke up to some fuck shit smh <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/TGar1PbBDz</a></p>— DRAM back (@shelleysaid) <a href=#>November 4, 2022</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cla2t7wpc00593h6h5ryh89by@published>Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cla2nqjvh001l3h6h0y1omjyd@published data-word-count=144>DRAM wasn’t the only old drama Drake resurfaced. He reminded the world of speculation around him and tennis star Serena Williams on “Middle of the Ocean,” in one of the album’s most direct shots. “Sidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie,” he raps, referring to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, Williams’s husband since 2017. “He claim we don’t got a problem but / No, boo, it is like you comin’ for sushi,” he adds, dropping a reference to the sushi restaurant into this beef. Ohanian responded on Twitter with a photo of him and daughter Alexis watching Williams play tennis. “The reason I stay winning is because I’m relentless about being the absolute best at whatever I do — including being the best groupie for my wife & daughter,” he wrote, in on the joke. Williams replied with some emoji, to make it a team effort.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The reason I stay winning is because I'm relentless about being the absolute best at whatever I do — including being the best groupie for my wife & daughter. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oaEKuRWFnj</a></p>— AlexisOhanian7️⃣7️⃣6️⃣ (@alexisohanian) <a href=#>November 4, 2022</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cla2t901t005j3h6h6cx14pe1@published>Ice Spice</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cla2ornw0002i3h6h3hni5sct@published data-word-count=116>Here’s where things get a little murky. “She a ten tryna rap, it’s good on mute,” Drake raps on “BackOutsideBoyz,” which fans quickly assumed to refer to ascendant rapper Ice Spice. There’s no detail that directly ties that line to Ice, but Drake did fly her out to OVO Fest in Toronto in August, after praising her song “Munch” and a freestyle as “hard,” which is the opposite of “good on mute.” Drake unfollowed Ice sometime after their Toronto meetup, leading some to think he now has beef with the rapper. Once she was done <a href=#>paying attention to</a> NLE Choppa’s new song named after her, Ice <a href=#>tweeted</a> a short response to Drake: “at least ima 10.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>at least ima 10 🤷‍♀️😂</p>— Ice Spice ☆ (@icespicee_) <a href=#>November 4, 2022</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cla2t994x005o3h6h2mdj0srn@published>Republicans</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cla2o4vyk001v3h6hcuca01t8@published data-word-count=105>Early into Her Loss, Drake calls himself a feminist: “I blow a half a million on you hoes,” he raps on “On BS,” which is … not quite the definition. But amid the misogyny lurking on the album, he does throw in one somewhat feminist statement. “Damn, just turned on the news and seen that men who never got pussy in school / Are makin’ laws about what women can do,” he raps on “Spin Bout U.” Yes, it’s still very much predicated on seeing women as sexual objects, but anti-choice conservatives do deserve some heat. The Republican Party has not responded to Drake’s claims.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cla2xd2ct000t3e6o2x5u371q@published data-word-count=5>This post has been updated.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cla9t65aw0000wrdyjjjryhn3@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Do Your Thing, Drake (Yeah)</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cla2iob590000kqewjk354d3p@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Megan Thee Stallion Bodies Drake for Questioning Her Shooting</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cla18cvrd00002cgup3x1x71g@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Drake and 21 Savage’s Her Loss Is Now Our Gain</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>All the Shots Drake Takes on Her Loss</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpa2dhZnylvsCknGakqae2pL%2BMppygmZ5iwamxxGaqrZmcobawuoysnKudnpZ6uLXLpaCapaNisaq%2F0p6qZ6Ckork%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
