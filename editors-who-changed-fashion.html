She redefined the meaning of fashion magazine by allocating space for photography, art, homes, and fiction writing in the magazine's pages—in addition to regular fashion stories. Her motto was "Elegance is good taste plus a dash of daring," and its influence can still be seen in <i>BAZAAR's</i> pages today.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Diana Vreeland:</strong> <i>Harper's BAZAAR's</i> own Diana Vreeland has often been referred to as The Empress of Fashion. She was a tastemaker, defining fashion through her exploration and constant determination of the next big thing. During her tenure at <i>BAZAAR</i> (1936-62), she propelled Lauren Bacall into fame by making her the cover girl of the March 1943 issue, and her infamous "Why Don't You?" column still resonates today.</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Grace Mirabella</h2><img alt="this image is not available" data-cy=slide-image-2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1971, when Grace Mirabella replaced Diana Vreeland as Editor-in-Chief of <i>Vogue</i>, she shocked the fashion world. Mirabella wasn't editorial; she came from the business world. Her parents were Italian immigrants, not socialites, and her only connection to the magazine was that she had worked diligently as Vreeland's former assistant. But in 17 years, she tripled the magazine's circulation and proved that business skills are vital in the editorial world. She also supported American designers such as Geoffrey Beene and Calvin Klein, ushering in an era of wearability for the everyday woman. In the '90s she started her own successful publication, <i>Mirabella</i>.</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Ingrid Sischy</h2><img alt="this image is not available" data-cy=slide-image-3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The influential South-African writer created an intersection of fashion, art, and culture that still exists in popular publications today. As the editor of <i>Artforum, </i>she featured a model in a bodysuit by Issey Miyake on the cover in 1982. She began writing for <i>The New Yorker</i> on fashion and photography before becoming Editor-in-Chief of <i>Interview</i>. Until her recent death, she worked as a Contributing Editor of <i>Vanity Fair,</i> merging some of her trademark topics together with celebrity culture, and interviewing everyone from Madonna to John Galliano.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Franca Sozzani</h2><img alt="this image is not available" data-cy=slide-image-4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Since 1988, Franca Sozzani has been the groundbreaking editor of <i>Vogue Italia</i>. As a huge supporter of the democratization of fashion, she regularly styles fast fashion with luxury on her pages. She has also been instrumental in supporting all ethnicities and sizes when it comes to models: Sozzani has featured multiple plus-sized models on covers, devoted an entire issue to all-black models and an issue of <i>L'Uomo Vogue</i> to African culture.</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Suzy Menkes</h2><img alt="this image is not available" data-cy=slide-image-5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The celebrated fashion critic spent 25 years covering the industry for the <i>International Herald Tribune</i> before moving on to write for other outlets, including <i>Harper's BAZAAR</i> and <i>Vogue</i>. Her pieces can either make or break a collection. In the '90s, she wrote that Chanel's quilted handbags were out of style, and more recently, she challenged Marc Jacobs for a fashion show that started almost two hours late. She is now the International Fashion Editor of all international editions of <i>Vogue</i>.</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Anna Wintour</h2><img alt="this image is not available" data-cy=slide-image-6 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As Editor-in-Chief of <i>Vogue</i>, Anna Wintour transformed the magazine into a cultural phenomenon. She popularized high fashion for a new generation of women when she was brought in as editor in 1987—her first cover pictured a carefree pregnant woman mixing high and low fashion with lots of costume jewelry. Wintour shifted the whole culture of fashion into something young women were inspired by, making <i>Vogue</i> a mainstay for a new demographic. Her focus has always been on fashion as a lifestyle.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Liz Tilberis</h2><img alt="this image is not available" data-cy=slide-image-7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">From 1992 to 1999, Editor-in-Chief Liz Tilberis transformed <i>Harper's BAZAAR</i>, making it a major, unique voice in the fashion space. Tilberis' goal was to make the magazine the most beautiful in the world, and in doing so she inspired competitors to rethink their visuals. She hired top-notch stylists and the legendary art director Fabien Baron. <i>BAZAAR's</i> first issue under Tilberis, September 1992, featured a stunning Linda Evangelista on the cover, photographed by Patrick Demarchelier. There was only one coverline: ''Enter the Era of Elegance."</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Glenda Bailey</h2><img alt="this image is not available" data-cy=slide-image-8 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After working as Editor-in-Chief for both the British and American editions of <i>Marie Claire</i>, Glenda Bailey came to <i>Harper's BAZAAR</i> in 2001. Under her editorship, the magazine increased its circulation by 80 percent. Known for making a splash with fashion, art, and celebrity, she made <i>Marie Claire</i> in the UK such a hot magazine that she was featured in an American Express commercial and in advertisements all over London. She's been praised for her bold ideas (think Demi Moore posing on a floating staircase with a giraffe or Karl Lagerfeld acting as a rapper), her love for the process, her craft of editing, and her focus on readers.</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Robin Givhan</h2><img alt="this image is not available" data-cy=slide-image-9 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the past 10 years, Robin Givhan's smart, sharp fashion criticism has had a home at <i>The Washington Post</i>. She's the only writer to ever win a Pulitzer Prize (2006) for fashion criticism, opening serious conversations within the field. Her writing is witty and challenging, and her coverage often touches on the social impact of style, race in fashion, and the political sphere. <strong></strong></p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Carine Roitfeld</h2><img alt="this image is not available" data-cy=slide-image-10 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The former editor of <i>Vogue Paris</i> revolutionized the magazine's pages with lots of high fashion, often made controversial in the hands of fashion photographer Terry Richardson. In 2012, she brought her unique vision to <i>Harper's BAZAAR</i> as the global fashion director and also launched her own publication, <i>CR Fashion Book</i>. Her personal street style is also unrivaled.</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Cathy Horyn</h2><img alt="this image is not available" data-cy=slide-image-11 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She officially resigned from her position as fashion critic at <i>The New York Times </i>in January 2014, but the world will forever remember Cathy Horyn's honest and raw fashion criticism. Readers follow her byline at various publications. Her humorous, opinionated style provides a provocative look at the industry. Banned from numerous shows for negative reviews or challenging designers, she won a Eugenia Shepard Award from the CFDA in 2002 for writing about the ethics behind <i>Vogue's</i> deal-making. <strong></strong></p><p><h6 class="css-1qmam5g e1a8voem2"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-0 e1a8voem1">Watch Next</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h6 class="css-4iho3 e1a8voem0">&nbsp;</h6></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Harper's BAZAAR Culture Playlist" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/17/13/1490603250-gettyimages-611909784.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGielZbBtr7ErGagbmRtfXCxw6KrqKqjYsSpu4ycn5qml5qxbrLArJ%2Bip55k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
