But fans can’t get over Elizabeth Debicki’s face when she realized she had won at the SAG Awards – and neither can we. Even though she’s been in <a href=#>Hollywood</a> for more than a decade, this meant a lot to her. The <a href=#>awards show</a> had a few surprises and emotional acceptance speeches throughout the night. From <a href=#>Pedro Pascal’s ‘drunk’ confession</a> to the best-dressed on the <a href=#>SAGA Red Carpet</a>, we’ve been spoiled this year.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2028791718-717x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-elizabeth-debicki-s-genuine-reaction-at-the-sag-awards>Elizabeth Debicki’s genuine reaction at the SAG Awards</h2><p>The 6’3 star was shocked to hear her name be called out on stage, but Elizabeth Debicki didn’t let that stop her from kicking off her shoes to accept her statue at the SAG Awards.</p><p>On Saturday, she clearly didn’t think she was going to win, and it made it all more real from the <a href=#>movie</a> star.</p><p>She said: “I’m not wearing shoes right now. I don’t really know what to say, so I’m just gonna wing it.”</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> paid tribute to the other nominees in her category. She was up against <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> for The Morning Show and Bella Ramsey from The Last of Us. Succession’s Sarah Snook and Keri Russell from The Diplomat were also beaten to the microphone.</p><p>Elizabeth continued: “The women in my category, I watch with total awe and I learned how to do my craft watching you, so being nominated next to you is incredible.</p><p>“I really, really love my job. A week ago, I had the flu, and I was laying in bed. I was thinking about childhood, and I was thinking about a happy memory.”</p><p>The actress continues: “I remembered the first time I was ever cast in a play. I was year five, I must have been 10.</p><p>“I think someone’s parent wrote it, and it was about… kids getting along, I don’t think it was an actual play.</p><p>“Somebody gave me that part on the last day of school. It was a 15-minute walk home, and I think I just levitated home. I was so happy. I feel like that every time someone gives me a job.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-star-among-stars>‘A star among stars’</h2><p>Fans loved her real reaction as she stood up blinking in awe.</p><p>One wrote: “She wasn’t expecting it,” and another declared: “Elizabeth Debicki’s grace and skill truly make her a star among stars.”</p><p>A third said: “She must be over the moon! It’s like capturing a comet, a rare and beautiful achievement.”</p><p>One <a href=#>Twitter</a> use also felt the moment, saying: “Goosebumps right. You earned it woman. You’re a terrific actress.”</p><p>And lastly someone said the video was “priceless”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-luckily-no-one-mistakes-her-for-princess-diana>Luckily, no one mistakes her for Princess Diana</h2><p>Although Elizabeth Debicki won at the SAG Awards for her portrayal of <a href=#>Princess Diana</a> in The Crown, she doesn’t get stopped in public because of it.</p><p>She <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> Entertainment Weekly she isn’t recognized in public for playing the famous <a href=#>royal</a>. This must be a highlight considering how famous Hollywood stars are on the street.</p><p>“In my real life, I very rarely get recognized as Princess Diana,” Elizabeth said.</p><p>“People say, ‘Oh, what do you do?’ ‘Oh I’m an actor.’ ‘What have I seen you in?’ ‘Have you seen&nbsp;The Crown?’ ‘Oh yeah, I love that show.’ It’s like, ‘do I do the next bit…?’</p><p>“It’s a testament to the crew, the hair and makeup team!”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eCcLHLorGampWptW6wxJugnKOZqHqnrcKeZJqsXam1pnnSmp5mmaeWv6W%2FjKacmqakYruwec6nnGabkaeypXnSoZxmoJGZeq%2B7jKyfqJ2jYryvew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
