I never meant for that verse to be heard, I was heated in the moment and thought better of it and decided to pull it back,” read a statement that the rapper shared to Twitter on June 24.</p><p lang=es dir=ltr>In response to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@revolttv</a>… <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/XrFJi2BZDy</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>— Marshall Mathers (@Eminem) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>June 25, 2020</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Eminem claimed that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the leak</a>, which happened amid the Black Lives Matter movement, was out of his control (REVOLT TV previously voiced its skepticism over how the lyrics were “leaked.”). “Stuff that I never intended to release continues to leak from the huge WeTransfer hack. I don’t have any issues with Revolt…I’d actually welcome the opportunity to work with them on some positive things and turn this in a different direction,” Eminem concluded.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In the leaked lyrics, Eminem came after the Black-owned media company owned by Diddy: “Yeah, shout to Puffy Combs, but f–k REVOLT/Y’all are like a f–ked up remote/Now I get it why our button’s broke, cause you pressing the heat but do nothing though, especially when it comes to punch this throne.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In another line, Eminem seemed to take a jab at Joe. The “Lose Yourself” rapper referenced the time Joe, who was co-hosting interviews for Everyday Struggle at the 2017 BET Awards, dropped his mic and and literally walked away from an awkward interview with <strong>Migos</strong>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Eminem disses Revolt, Joe Budden, and MGK in unreleased verse from Conway’s “Bang.” “Shoutout Puffy Combs, but fuck Revolt. Y’all are like a fucked up remote. Now I get why our buttons broke…”👀‼️ <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/BSfiopKvsC</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>— Hip Hop Ties (@HipHopTies) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>June 22, 2020</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“Wasted tissue, tell this journalist stick to the stuff he know, like always running, from Migos,” Eminem rapped. An awkward diss, considering that Joe is now a co-host with Diddy on <i>State of the Culture</i>, a late night talk show on REVOLT TV.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>After the leaked lyrics made their rounds on the Internet, REVOLT TV didn’t take long to throw the shade back. “F–K YOU TOO EMINEM,” read a statement on REVOLT TV’s Instagram account, which the company shared on its Twitter as well. Diddy’s company further explained why Eminem’s beef was ill-directed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>“Why does Eminem, someone who is a guest in Black culture, think he can talk down to REVOLT. REVOLT is a BLACK media company, owned by a Black entrepreneur, with a majority Black team – that is authentic and real about this,” the company wrote in a statement, obtained by Billboard. “With the immediate need for REVOLT to use our platform for the important issues regarding social justice, equality, and ensuring continuing to be the outlet – across ALL OUR PLATFORMS, we’re doing important work. Eminem trying to come for us is an unneeded distraction. It is not OK.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>REVOLT TV further explained why it was irked by Eminem’s words. “What Em’s ‘mess’ could’ve done – is it could’ve harmed our business. Fortunately, it was a minor social media distraction, but the potential implications should not be OK,” the statement further explained. “We’re busy using our energies, efforts and platforms as a Catalyst for Change. The real question is what is Eminem doing – other than being a distraction. If the diss was intended for Joe Budden why include REVOLT? REVOLT has supported both artists throughout their careers – and has zero to do with their beef with each other. And how did this verse supposedly and allegedly get ‘leaked’ anyway.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH13e5FtZp6lmaOyrnnAqaalp5euerTAwK2cpp2eqXqzsdWoo61lpKt6q7vEZpmunJSau26wyJ2bsmWUnsC0ecGapaBn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
