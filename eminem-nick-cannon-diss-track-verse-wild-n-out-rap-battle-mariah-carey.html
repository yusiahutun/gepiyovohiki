"U mad bro?" he asked before dismissing Nick's claims that he has a chauffeur before wrapping up his comments with a clown emoji. We think it's pretty clear what that meant.</p><p>In a quick follow-up tweet, though, the rapper went all parody and humor, sarcastically demanding an apology from <strong><a href=#>"The Masked Singer"</a></strong> host.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>U mad bro?

Both Eminem and Nick Cannon have playful sides, but they've both been known to get fired up and passionate about things, too.</p><p>And in this case, Nick is doing all of this in defense of his ex-wife, and baby mama, Mariah Carey after Em's latest blast at her ... a target he's been shooting at for decades.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a972684a-1c86-52cc-a745-4c2022c690ed data-container-ref=toofab:article:3c546de5-e086-54cd-8c97-2dea61568bdd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/eb/5by4/2019/11/07/ebb2ba17462f56728ed0d2fe25fb2edf_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">TooFab/Epic Records</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">When Is It Okay to Start Blasting Holiday Music?</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Em also lobbed a few lines at Nick himself, which is again nothing really new. Eminem and Mariah were briefly connected years ago, though Mariah has denied they ever hooked up, and the rapper has never quite let her drop off his radar when it comes to names to drop in his music.</p><p>Nor, does it seem, he's completely let go. Either that, or he's just playing ... hard!</p><p>The latest back-and-forth came in response to Cannon dropping a diss track called "The Invitation" as an official response to <strong><a href=#>Eminem's initial diss</a></strong>. In the new song, which feature Suge Knight in an opening monologue backing Nick, who he calls "family." As for Em, Suge calls him "a bitch."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:07e8d605-0c81-5266-a768-2a4b36d8745c data-container-ref=toofab:article:3c546de5-e086-54cd-8c97-2dea61568bdd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ec/5by4/2019/12/06/ecc622954119525e825a6e77f8a22e0d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Snooki Quits Jersey Shore: 'I Just Can't Do It Anymore'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Check out Nick's verse below, where he name-drops Eminem's ex Kim, as well as his daughter Hailie:</p><p>I f--k with crack, but the white boy he f--k with crack (crack)</p><p>Pills and smack, shit, and he about to relapse</p><p>Call Kim, somebody get Hailie</p><p>And that other kid you raisin', that ain't even your baby (daddy)</p><p>Took a page out of Drake's book, this might get a Grammy</p><p>We going back to back 'til you respond on the family</p><p>My baby mama killed you off a decade ago</p><p>You're still crying about it, bitch, now who really the ho?</p><p>I called Joe to set you up and you fell for the job</p><p>Slim won't show for the video, 'cause he terrified of my squad</p><p>I heard your chauffeur got a video of you suckin' a c--k</p><p>You paid him off, then laid him off, now who really the opp?</p><p>Suge called me the new Pac, I ain't no killer but don't push me</p><p>How the f--k y'all got me battlin' Elvis Pussly?</p><p>The rest of the track laid into Em as well, with verses by rappers Hitman Holla, Prince Eazy and Charlie Clips, but Eminem didn't bother to respond to them. Having come up in battles, it's probably pretty easy to dismiss most who come after his self-proclaimed crown. But there's just something about Nick that Em can't leave be.</p><p>This whole thing comes a few days after Eminem used his verse in Fat Joe and Dre's track "Lord Above" to skewer Nick and Mariah.</p><p>In "Lord Above," Eminem raps, "Word to the Terror Squad, Joe, this is all puns aside though / I know me and Mariah didn't end on a high note / But that other dude's whipped, that p---y got him neutered / Tried to tell him this chick's a nut job before he got his jewels clipped / Almost got my caboose kicked, fool, quit, you not gon' do shit / I let her chop my balls off, too 'fore I lost to you, Nick."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d6cd4539-493d-5126-9b50-1128ff51e904 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3c546de5-e086-54cd-8c97-2dea61568bdd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6b/5by4/2019/12/06/6bda42a1f92051ebb9a78874b4a2842f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Sean Hannity Randomly Dares Jimmy Kimmel to Restart Their Squashed 2018 Feud</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Nick immediately took to social media in response to the verse, and even trashed Eminem on his Power 106 radio show, "Nick Cannon Mornings" on Friday. But his ire must have stayed up as he couldn't let it sit with those responses, elevating things to a diss track of his own.</p><p>Nick even <strong><a href=#>praised Fat Joe's new album</a></strong>, while also continuing to diss Eminem. In the post, above, Fat Joe is featured alongside many of the artists featured on the new album. Over Eminem's pic, however, Cannon put a grandpa emoji.</p><p>"@FatJoe album is ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Star studded, he even did some charity work and dug @Eminem out his grave I mean cave!!" he captioned the post.</p><p>The pair first tussled publicly shortly after Nick and Mariah wed in 2008. In response, Eminem released "Bagpipes from Baghdad," where he asked, "Mariah whatever happened to us/Why did we ever have to break up?"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c23054a1-4f05-5a8d-8d6e-878f7f8c0fde data-container-ref=toofab:article:3c546de5-e086-54cd-8c97-2dea61568bdd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/37/5by4/2019/12/05/374d0788cd1354dc9310d0e642c45e98_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Fox</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">The Masked Singer Reveals Familiar Face from One of the Biggest Acts in Music History</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In the song, he also said he wanted her back and told Cannon to "back the f--- up." Cannon was looking to battle him on "Wild 'N Out" then, and he's apparently ready and eager to do it now, too.</p><p>That said, why invite Emimen to a place that's clearly going to be in Nick's corner? How about some neutral ground if they really want to throw down in a rap battle. Maybe James Corden could take it on in an installment of "Drop the Mic" that gets way, way, way too real.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
