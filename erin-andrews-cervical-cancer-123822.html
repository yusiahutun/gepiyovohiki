That’s going to be me.”</p><p>“Should I have been standing for a full game five days after surgery? Let’s just say the doctor didn’t recommend that. But… sports were my escape. I needed to be with my crew,” Erin said, adding she chose to not disclose her cancer battle to her bosses and colleagues at the time. “In a way, this all has allowed me [to relate] to players more. I understand what it’s like to be the story.”</p><p><a href=#>MUST SEE: Giuliana Rancic Celebrates Being Five Years Cancer-Free With Touching Instagram Post</a></p><p>A few weeks later, Erin underwent a second cervical cancer surgery on Nov. 1, 2016.
