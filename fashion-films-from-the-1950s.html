With the help of major fashion editor Maggie Prescott—whose character was based off of BAZAAR's own Diana Vreeland—famously friends with Avedon in real life—Jo becomes fashion's newest darling through a series of gorgeous photo shoots staged throughout Paris. With the help of the legendary Edith Head as costume designer and an array of breathtaking Givenchy gowns, Funny Face is a fashion show in itself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>2) To Catch a Thief, 1955<br></strong>Hitchcock's most memorable blonde, Grace Kelly, stars alongside Cary Grant in this love story thiller. With the costume design also helmed by Edith Head, To Catch a Thief not only defines Hitchcock's quintessential heroine (blonde curls, a bold red lip and Dior's New Look silhouette), it also captures the elegant style of the '50s—which fashion still continues to reference to this day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>3) Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, 1953</strong><br>The movie that calls itself, 'the most glamorous musical of all time,' Gentlemen Prefer Blondes features an array of eye-catching outfits worn by Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell, who star as showgirls in search of rich husbands. From that iconic pink gown in the "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend" musical number to the showgirls' extravagant costumes, this film is a must-see for the fashion obsessed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>4) Sabrina, 1954</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In one of her first films, Audrey Hepburn stars as Sabrina—the quiet girl next door who catches the attention of two wealthy brothers after evolving into a chic young woman while studying abroad in Paris. The film's standout gown moments (which include Sabrina dancing dreamily around a tennis court in the dark, as one does) began the iconic designer-celebrity relationship between Hubert de Givenchy and Hepburn, a fashion pairing that lasted through the rest of the actress's life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>5) All About Eve, 1950<br></strong>Although not directly related to fashion or the fashion industry, All About Eve could be considered the early version of The Devil Wears Prada. Highlighting female competitiveness (especially in the workplace), the film follows Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter), a young and aspiring actress who manipulates Broadway superstar Margo Channing (Bette Davis) to taking her under her wing. In no time, Eve manages to steal Margo's spotlight, career and friends. This catty film is still referenced in both pop culture and fashion to this day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>6) Rebel Without A Cause, 1955<br></strong>Consider this your "borrowed from the boys" inspiration: Rebel Without A Cause is definitely not a fashion film, but the fashion in the film is a must-see. James Dean set the fashion tone for rebellious teenage youth of the 1950s in blue jeans, a white t-shirt and a bold red leather jacket.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>7) And God Created Woman, 1956<br></strong>In what launched bombshell Brigitte Bardot's career, French film And God Created Woman turned the French actress into an overnight sex symbol. Bardot plays Juliette, an 18-year-old who stirs drama as she captures the attention of many different men. The film ends with the line "That girl was made to destroy men," sealing the sultry status Bardot became known for.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>8) High Society, 1956<br></strong>High Society, Grace Kelly's final acting role before becoming Princess of Monaco, features Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra alongside the leading lady. The musical follows Kelly's fashion-loving socialite as she's pursued by three different suitors. With costume design by Helen Rose, Kelly wears an array of beautiful gowns accessorized with her own engagement ring from Prince Rainier III. The movie perfectly captures the elegance and ladylike silhouettes that defined the decade.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>9) Designing Woman, 1957<br></strong>Lauren Bacall and Gregory Peck star as a fashion designer and sports writer who marry quickly after falling in love while on vacation. Bacall's Marilla stuns her husband with an endless supply of designer clothes: "This was just the first in the series of wardrobe changes, which never failed to amaze me. Believe me, this kid changed her clothes nine times a day!" Gregory Peck's character exclaims. The two opposites struggle in their new marriage in this romantic comedy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>10) Rear Window, 1954<br></strong>Regarded as one of Hitchcock's greatest films, Rear Window stars Grace Kelly as Lisa Fremont, a fashion editor with a beautiful wardrobe created by costume designer Edith Head. Fremont's socialite character never wears the same outfit twice and loves a "dress that's fresh from a Paris plane" in the thriller.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/765453da-3fc9-4650-8bff-01664371711e_1704808979.png alt="Headshot of Lauren Alexis Fisher" title="Headshot of Lauren Alexis Fisher" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Lauren Alexis Fisher is the Senior Editor at Cosmopolitan, overseeing digital content across fashion, lifestyle, beauty, sex, and culture.
