Just days after her look at Valentino's fall/winter 2022 haute couture runway show turned heads and caused a wave of outrage on social media, the actress spoke up.
On Friday, Pugh attended the show in Rome wearing a stunning sheer hot pink tulle gown by the Italian fashion house—with no bra. Her hair was slicked back, and she opted for a natural, rosy makeup look."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Whether it be negative or positive, we all knew what we were doing. I was excited to wear it, not a wink of me was nervous. I wasn't before, during or even now after," she started the caption.</p><p>"What's been interesting to watch and witness is just how easy it is for men to totally destroy a woman's body, publicly, proudly, for everyone to see. You even do it with your job titles and work emails in your bio..?" she added.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actress went on to address the endless criticism women face at the hands of men, and strangers, for how they look, and said she's happy she was raised to believe in herself and appreciate her body and "flaws."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It isn't the first time and certainly won't be the last time a woman will hear what's wrong with her body by a crowd of strangers, what's worrying is just how vulgar some of you men can be," Pugh wrote. "So many of you wanted to aggressively let me know how disappointed you were by my 'tiny tits,' or how I should be embarrassed by being so 'flat chested.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added that what is "concerning" is why people are "so loudly upset" by the size and look of a woman's breasts and feel the need to shame them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'm very grateful that I grew up in a household with very strong, powerful, curvy women. We were raised to find power in the creases of our body. To be loud about being comfortable. It has always been my mission in this industry to say 'fuck it and fuck that' whenever anyone expects my body to morph into an opinion of what's hot or sexually attractive," she wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the last slide of her Instagram carrousel, Pugh added a photo of her covering her nipples with her fingers, "for those who feel more comfortable with that inch of darker skin to be covered," she shared.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Grow up. Respect people. Respect bodies. Respect all women. Respect humans. Life will get a whole lot easier, I promise. And all because of two cute little nipples," she wrote.
