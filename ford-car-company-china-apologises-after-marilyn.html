At the end of the post which was aimed to promote Ford’s new SUV, the company said “Ruijie Plus (the car’s brand) will glut your eyes”.
Both the original post and the video were removed by the company later the same day after many online criticised the advertisement as “vulgar” for showing a woman’s legs."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It has breached the bottom line. I don’t know what Ford’s marketing staff are thinking about,” wrote one person on Weibo.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think they are doing it intentionally to arouse public criticism. Ford knew this kind of video will be lambasted, and its apology should have already been prepared,” the other user said. “They want to make its ad more impressive to you for ordinary ads can’t attract people now.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company issued a statement after removing the video.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have realised we are wrong,” the company said on Weibo. “We immediately cancelled what we released and apologised sincerely.

Why do you think it’s vulgar? How can you tell it does not respect women? Aren’t the beautiful legs part of the beauty of women? People said this ad is not good only because of the ugliness in their own heart.”</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/03/23/clean_3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:06</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Chinese real estate developer displays floor plans on models’ backs</p><p>Chinese real estate developer displays floor plans on models’ backs</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If the ad with women’s legs revealed is regarded as vulgar, I think our country should ban women from wearing bikinis and wearing the skirts not long enough to cover their knees,” another commenter said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">State media Xinhua News Agency weighed into the debate by urging the company not to “pursue vulgarity”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Advertisement is an art creation work, but it’s not a good creative idea to gain notoriety with shocking words or behaviours,” said Xinhua.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s not the first time that Ford was embroiled in controversy with one of its commercials. In January it released a poster for its electric car containing Chinese characters meaning “2021, China, Year of Horse”. The company called this type of car: “the most famous horse of Ford”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This was met with anger online as 2021 is the Year of Ox on the Chinese zodiac. The company later deleted the ad online.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0minnqegobJur9Slq66qlWTBs7HNnaCnn12Ytaq6wGiYq6yZmLmme5Jqam1paGl8p7vRnWScmaJisLC5z5qlsmWTnbavrYyap6ikn5y2tLHSZpifrJWneq6t0aKjsqY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
