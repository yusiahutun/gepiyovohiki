I was much better off going the route I did.”</p><p>Michael accepts lead roles are some way off following his extensive break and he is happy to learn his trade by attending acting classes — something he&nbsp;never did before Forrest Gump.</p><p>He was plucked from obscurity to play Forrest after attending a casting call for a “a young&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Hanks</a>&nbsp;with light eyes and a quirky disposition”.</p><p>Tom, who won a Best Actor Oscar for the role, took the bumbling, big-hearted character through adulthood, as he appeared at significant moments in US culture and delivered memorable lines including: “Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know which one you’re gonna get.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Michael’s thick southern drawl was Tom’s inspiration for Forrest’s accent in the film, which also starred Robin Wright as love interest Jenny.</p><p>Looking back at those times, Michael insists he does not regret turning down other films on the back of Forrest Gump’s box office success.</p><p>A major factor behind his decision to stay in school was his parents who — unlike many who guide the ­acting careers of their kids — were not pushy despite the huge sums of money on offer.</p><p>Michael said: “Back then, my parents just let me decide for myself what I wanted to do next and they never pushed me to pursue other acting roles.</p><p>“I honestly think that was a good thing, as I never thought of Hollywood as anything glamorous or fame as something I wanted to chase. It was the opposite.</p><p>“I loved my home and was just interested in having fun and playing with my friends, especially as I liked school.</p><p>“Offers came in but I really wasn’t that concerned with trying to pick up more roles after that.</p><p>“The Brady Bunch movie is one I turned down and our family had no intention of moving to LA full-time either.</p><p>“I was a kid and did not have the mentality of a Hollywood actor, being self-centred about making it above anything.”</p><p>Single Michael lives on his own in a ­Spanish-style blue-fronted house in the centre of Portland.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/0137fea1-a377-4600-88a6-568662fad2eb.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZWaEcoKVaJ2oqqKawLV5xq6kqWWdnrCprcSlZKGtnaW1s7HYrGSupqKasLCzzaKqmpqcmnqivsyyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
