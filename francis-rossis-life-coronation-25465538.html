became great friends, with Rick joining the band.</p><p>Changing their name to The Traffic Jam, they eventually became known as Status Quo in 1967, and had their first hit single, Pictures of Matchstick Men in 1968, which has since been covered by artists including Ozzy Osbourne.</p><h3>Record breakers</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25439757.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Louis-Dunford-Review-Gritty-singer-songwriter-spills-heart-to-home-town-crowd.jpg><p>They finally achieved their first number one in 1974 with the rock anthem Down Down, and, since then, have released hit singles including Whatever you Want, In the Army Now, Margarita Time and Something 'Bout You Baby I Like.</p><p>With over 85 singles and having sold 120million albums across the world, it's no surprise that the group have broken numerous records during their career.</p><p>They hold the Guinness World Record for the most hit singles on the UK chart by any band, totalling 66, and also performed on BBC programme Top of the Pops 100 times - more than any group in history.</p><p>Both Francis and Rick also provided vocals for the 1984 song Do They Know It's Christmas, and most poignantly opened up Live Aid in 1985 with their anthem Rocking All Over The World.</p><p>From there, Status Quo were also awarded a BRIT Award in 1991 for their contributions to music.</p><h3>Cocaine habit</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Francis has admitted that he became reliant on alcohol and drugs during Status Quo's heyday, spending almost £2million on his habit.</p><p>He previously told the Telegraph that he would spend £1,200 on booze and drugs in the late 1970s, and the band's fame meant he could easily afford it – but it started to take its toll on his body.</p><p>"From about 1979 to 1987, I did loads of coke. I used to wash my nose out in the shower. One day, a bit of septum fell out - I heard it go down the shower," he said.</p><p>Francis told The Sun: "I sniffed coke every day for four years. But it’s not like the massive amounts you see in the movies.</p><p>“We did what was called a ‘tuke’, a quick sniff just to keep things going until the dip would come in. It would be quite good if I could knock two before midday.”</p><p>Eventually though, he was able to kick his habit.</p><h3>Coronation Street stint</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25465956.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Status-Quo-In-Japan.jpg><p>Soap fans were delighted when, in 2005, they made an unexpected appearance in ITV soap Coronation Street for three episodes.</p><p>In the storyline, their tour bus breaks down and they make a sudden entrance into the Rovers Return, asking if there is anything to eat.</p><p>From there, they get unexpectedly roped into playing at the wedding of Cilla and Les Battersby, before running off to their tour bus at the end of the episodes.</p><p>In his autobiography, I Talk Too Much, Francis described the experience as great and said that the actors were brilliant, even revealing that he loves playing the Coronation Street theme tune on his acoustic guitar.</p><h3>Close friendship</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25465957.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Quo-Rock-Out.jpg><p>In 2009, both Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt were also made Officers of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and continued to tour across the world.</p><p>However in 2016, Rick died aged 68 from sepsis as a result of an infection from a pre-existing shoulder injury.</p><p>Talking to Planet Rock, Francis described Rick as "one of the best friends I've ever had".</p><p>He added that he misses him and that he still often dreams about performing concerts with Rick, saying: "I dreamt about him last night and we were doing some sort of gig.</p><p>"In fact, when he first died, I dreamt a lot that he was there and I’d say to him ‘what are you doing?’ ‘What do you mean?’ ‘I thought you were dead!’ ‘No, I was.’"</p><h3>Womaniser ways</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25465964.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_16095004.jpg><p>Francis certainly enjoyed the rock'n'roll lifestyle, which even saw him bed hundreds of women – but he previously made it clear the notches on his bedpost hadn't crept into four digits.</p><p>He said in 2019: "Not even in the thousands. Now you’re disappointed.</p><p>“Do you know how long it would take to sleep with 1,000 women? Even two minutes at a time...”</p><h3>Family life</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25465965.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_MSP_StatusQuo_150415_13JPG.jpg><p>Francis continues to tour with Status Quo and lives with his wife Eileen in Surrey.</p><p>He has been married to Eileen since 1992, having previously been married to Jean Rossi from 1967-1979, and he also has eight children.</p><p>The now-72-year-old musician also told the Sunday People earlier this year that he has taken up drinking smoothies and regular exercise including power walks, hour-long fitness sessions and swimming in order to stay healthy for the performances.</p><p>He said: "I’ve been practising in my room at night. I’ve been trying to sing Paper Plane and I get about a quarter of the way through it and it just tires you out."</p><p>Francis added: "There is so much energy you use up in performing," and that he was hoping to "build up to 60 lengths for my lungs" in the swimming pool.</p><p><b><i>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters </i></b><a href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section><b><i>here</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25340313><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|Image aria-label="Ne-Yo reveals wife kicked him out of bed after hearing new song about ex-lovers" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25340313><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25465971.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_SM-HN-FRANCIS-ROSSI16JPG.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25340411.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Pride-of-Britain.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25340313>Ne-Yo reveals wife kicked him out of bed after hearing new song about ex-lovers</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25331121><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|Image aria-label="Freddie Mercury said 'I can't f***ing do this anymore' on his final Queen tour" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25331121><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25465970.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Status-Quo.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25331183.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Queen-Official.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25331121>Freddie Mercury said 'I can't f***ing do this anymore' on his final Queen tour</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdlonauZnpi2tHnRqKqsoaNiuaqyxGZknKeipLuiwMiopWZqZWmDdoGScQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
