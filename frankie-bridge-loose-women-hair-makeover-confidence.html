I've always said that I'd hate to look back and look the same in every picture.</p><p id=ejo6OAtSAvn data-wc=61>Being young and having fun with how you look is a part of growing up. I love that each hair change marks a feeling and a time in my life. If we don't try out lots of different styles, how will we know which one is the best for us? Hair grows and colours change; no look has to be forever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f82963488d1b-frankie-hair-transformation.jpg><p id=e2_BIVErUb data-wc=34>This week I went to the TV Baftas and decided to mix it up a bit and <a class=hm-link href=#>went orange for the night</a>. Everyone thought I had dyed it, but it was just hair wax.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5By9ovXNK data-wc=83>I'm not going to lie, just as I was ready to leave, I had a little panic about it. We had based the whole outfit around it and then suddenly I wasn’t sure. Going on a red carpet is daunting and I felt like a totally different person, but after taking a few pictures, I loved how different and playful it was. I got so many lovely compliments, and the best part was that I could wash it out when I got home!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e6cf3def0577-gettyimages-1490142717.jpg><p id=eTPi09XoLu data-wc=10><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Frankie Bridge shares her holiday must-haves and confidence-boosting tips</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Frankie Bridge's favourite hair look</strong></h2><p id=eFb-d4XcyiS data-wc=41>My favourite haircut is probably my best known; the short crop, with the big side fringe. Although I feel that since this cut I've had looks that suit me better, this is the one that holds the most memories for me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fc03159a18f6-frankie-saturdays-hair.jpg><p id=eWEozcpx1H_ data-wc=53>It's the style that made me stand out from the crowd, at a time when not many women were rocking short hair. It's the cut that so many people still come and tell me they tried after seeing mine. Some loved it and some regretted it, but they're all glad they tried it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9930a037c67a-frankie-satudays-haircut.jpg><p id=em1Ktkh1UGv data-wc=32>I love that I encouraged girls to be brave enough to take the chop, and made them realise that long hair is not the only way to feel sexy, confident or feminine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ad65714f9859-frankie-bridge-saturdays-fringe.jpg><p id=e84sD8JVLMxo data-wc=42>I've met lots of girls that say seeing me with short hair helped them to feel confident when they lost their hair through chemo. So not only did it give me a sense of confidence, it gave me a sense of pride.</p><p id=eqTHBxcr7l data-wc=16><strong>EXCLUSIVE: <a class=hm-link href=#>'There's a toxic amount of opinion': Frankie Bridge on ignoring the trolls and finding happiness</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Frankie's controversial hair choices</strong></h2><p id=e0R_reCpmXbI data-wc=77>There aren't any looks that I regret, but there are definitely some that I wouldn't do again! I had an emo stage that I love to look back on. It was a time of self-discovery and a rebellion from my S Club Juniors, 'girl next door' phase. But the looks were not great. I had yellow and black hair at one point. Yellow on the top, black on the bottom. Finished off with a little red bow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2fbfaab3df99-image003-1.jpg><p id=eKhmqdv2tOTw data-wc=28>Then I dyed it all black, cut in a fringe and used plastic clip-in extensions, some of which I lost in a mosh pit while watching Enter Shikari.</p><p id=e1YrnJAjRxva data-wc=34>I actually love showing people the version of me that they've never seen, &nbsp;as it's so unexpected and so far away from the Frankie that people have become used to seeing over the years.</p><p id=es07VxS-Lc data-wc=21><strong>SHOP:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Frankie Bridge reveals the £8 moisturiser she uses for flawless skin - and it’s just dropped in the Amazon sale</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>Frankie's most confidence-boosting haircut</strong></h3><p id=e9vOgthKH2rY data-wc=24>All my haircuts and colours have made me feel confident at the time. I just love having fun with it and trying things out.</p><p id=eo2k9SA5FoOw data-wc=58>I love the buzz I get from a new look, but it's sometimes short-lived. My poor long-suffering hairdresser <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Bobby Collier at Larry King</a> in London never knows how long a look is going to last and my colourist <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Mark at Jo Hansford in Harvey Nichols</a> is always getting sent unrealistic colour change ideas. I get bored so easily!</p><p id=e15rPoYIasGa data-wc=13>That being said, my pixie cut probably made me feel the most confident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6a8264932e15-frankie-short-hair.jpg><p id=eUleTfRbO4rw data-wc=61>It was such an empowering feeling to just chop it all off. I was so exposed as I was no longer able to hide behind the big side fringe. Which, if I'm being honest, had become a bit of a comfort blanket. It was particularly great to hide behind while being papped on nights out and perfect for hiding tired eyes!</p><p id=ed-qPAb0vx4A data-wc=17><strong>MORE FRANKIE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Frankie Bridge amazes in £34 broderie midi dress - and it's guaranteed to sell out</a></strong></p><p id=egIRAIQf-wCp data-wc=26>The crop made me feel more feminine than ever before and was a 'look' all by itself, so made picking what to wear so much easier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/035870483576-frankie-brunette-pixie-crop.jpg><p id=emiqsx074k6s data-wc=59>I've flip-flopped between long and short hair a few times over the years. Mostly going long when I'm going through a phase of feeling insecure about how I look, or when I'm bored of my hair always looking the same. Which is both a blessing and a curse with short hair, it's not something you can really style differently.</p><p id=eMEC9NBafwHI data-wc=30>I've been lucky enough to have one of the best people do my hair extensions. <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Hadley Yates at Hadley Yates in Soho</a> is talented and patient with my ever-changing mind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b6df07f4f979-frankie-bridge-long-hair.jpg><h2><strong>Frankie's long hair</strong></h2><p id=ep8a9s9Np-eR data-wc=67>I enjoy the long hair while I have it, and then one day I'll decide that I want it chopped off. I'm quite impulsive with my hair. My agent always says when she first met me I had my brown side fringe crop, then the next day we met for a meeting and a had a white blonde pixie cut. I hadn't even given her a heads-up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/86307fd19640-frankie-bridge-blonde-bob.jpg><h2><strong>Frankie Bridge's bob&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=eQwddua1OQTA data-wc=50>Most recently I had a choppy bob with a fringe. I loved it, but the novelty of the fringe wore off very quickly. It lasted longer than my stylist predicted though! I just couldn't style it as well as him and a fringe is hard to work with in pictures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5ceb85cc0a24-frankie-bridge-fringe.jpg><p id=eAQieBa-6yMx data-wc=23>Growing it out has not been fun, but luckily bangs have been a trend recently, so I've kind of got away with it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2a98b278e08d-frankie-bridge-bob-wavy.jpg><p id=eHb0-U8ruQk8 data-wc=72>The truth is, opposite to what most people believe, short hair takes a lot of upkeep. When I was in The Saturdays and our hairdresser Nick was with us every day, he could keep on top of it. Now being a working mum and only having one hairdresser that I trust, I just don't have the time to keep it looking how I'd like, so the mid-length I have now is perfect.</p><p id=eTamhufrn6 data-wc=14><strong>SHOP:</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Frankie Bridge's £12 new hair tool is a game changer for heatless curls</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=epI39oKBPsFS data-wc=34>I can go a long time without getting it cut, can play around with styles for nights out and red carpets, shove it in a bun or ponytail and change the colour pretty easily.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/33a2254fd024-frankie-bridge-updo.jpg><p id=eGYL3HrzU7ti data-wc=48>While maintenance is definitely something to consider when thinking of a new hairstyle, think of the fun, the memories or the confidence that you might gain. And remember, it can always be changed again.
