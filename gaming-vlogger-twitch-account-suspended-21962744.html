night of dancing and memes.</p><p>“Not to give more fire on the flame or however the f*** you say that, but I got one more thing to say.</p><p>“You guys knew I was Latina (yet) you expected me to have some nice pink nips – what the f***?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article21962104.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/2_BANNER-NURSE.jpg><p>She continued on her tirade: “If I had done it on purpose I would have made them look so much better.</p><p>“That lightning and angle didn’t do them any justice… no way that was on purpose.</p><p>“Bras f***ing suck, sl*ts rule, I love my body too much to let people’s opinions affect how I feel about it.”</p><p>Alinity, 32, was sanctioned for 24 hours by the Amazon-owned platform, but some users felt this wan’t enough.</p><p>Her wardrobe difficulty isn’t the first controversy the gamer has faced.</p><p>Alinity has a long-standing feud with PewDiePie – a blogging celebrity who once held the title of the most subscribed to channel on YouTube.</p><p><b>If you’re unable to see the survey, click here (use this URL</b><a href=# rel=nofollow>http://doo.vote/2504ef3</a> )</p><p>Swedish PewDiePie, real name Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg, has over 104 million subscribers and is estimated to be worth over £23m.</p><p>The feud involved Felix calling the 32-year-old a “Twitch th*t” on his livestream.</p><p>In response she asked her followers if she should “copy strike” the star.</p><p>This is slang for “copyright strike” and involves YouTube channels losing their monetisation due to infringements.</p><p>Alinity claims that Felix’s comments degrade women and are evidence of the “rampant sexism in online communities.”</p><p>Alinity has also faced the wrath of PETA and other animal rights groups for the treatment of her three cats, Maya, Milo And Nova.</p><p>In July last year, one of her cats interrupted her livestream and she aggressively threw the cat over her shoulder without looking so that she could resume the game.</p><img

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>After the incident, she said: “I didn’t think you guys would notice it, honestly.</p><p>“I thought I was fast enough that nobody would notice it – the cat flying around the screen – but I guess everybody did.”</p><p>In another incident Alinity takes a mouthful of vodka and allows a different cat to lick the substance off her mouth.</p><p>Alinity said in the video: “Vodka kiss, see, it is vodka.”</p><p>PETA accused her of “using the platform for animal abuse” and called for her removal.</p><p>She was investigated by the Saskatoon Society for the Prevention of Cruelty but they found her actions were not malicious.</p><p>Alinity wrote to her 316k Twitter followers: “I don’t know what the future has in store for me, but I welcome it with open arms: the success and failures, the love and hate, the beautiful and ugly.</p><p>“I will do my best to learn from my mistakes and tackle whatever comes next. I am not done yet.”</p><p>Alinity currently has around 1.08m followers on Twitch and over 63m views.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKqVlrluuMifnGifkaK2r7OMr6Oon5eav27A1qKrnKBdlrCku9Snq2arpai9prrDnptmamFug3ODk20%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
