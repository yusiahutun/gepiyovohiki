From April 9 to 12, the Gaming & Technology (GAT Expo 2024) will be going to Cartagena on Colombia’s Caribbean-facing coastline.</p><p>A mere five minutes away from the international airport, attendees and participants will set up shop in the Centro de Convenciones Cartagena (the Las Américas Convention Center), which boasts over 6,300 square meters of <a href=# rel=noopener>exhibition and conference space</a>. Better still for those making the trip, the center is part of the luxury hotel ensemble of the site, which includes the Caribbean Hotel Las Américas Casa de Playa on the beach and Hotel Las Américas Torre del Mar. Tickets for the expo go on sale soon, so here’s what visitors can look forward to.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Biggest brands in iGaming alongside poker and eSports tournaments</h2><p>Alongside the more academic elements of the GAT Expo 2024 Gaming Week, the show will also cater to major brands looking to showcase their biggest and best gaming breakthroughs while also staging a bunch of tournaments for attendees to enjoy. There’ll be live poker tournaments in play throughout, as well as eSports tournaments, inviting people to enjoy the gaming side at B2C events as well as the business side.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4.1-Biggest-brands-in-iGaming-alongside-poker-and-eSports-tournaments-Source-pixabay.jpg><p>Of course, for iGaming representatives, one of the biggest draws will be the major providers exhibiting their newest creations. One of the highlight brands coming is Pragmatic Play. Also a sponsor of the event, Pragmatic Play has rapidly ascended into the upper echelons of online casino gaming. Now, be it through their ever-popular slots or live casino games, the Pragmatic Play bomb logo is a trustworthy sign of top-quality gaming. This extends from industry names to customers.</p><p>Anyone <a href=# rel=noopener>looking for trusted online casinos</a> will often look for them to host well-known, top-class games. So, Wikibet hosting Safari King and Madame Destiny Megaways from Pragmatic Play is a stamp of approval, as is BC Game having Gates of Olympus. Of course, it won’t just be Pragmatic Play on show. Evolution, with its slots powered by NetEnt and Red Tiger, will have a stand in Cartagena, as will the likes of Novomatic, IGT, Inspired, and many others.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A stacked agenda for Cartagena</h2><p>It’s all about networking, learning, and exhibitions at the GAT Expo 2024 in Cartagena. Traditionally, the event also gets the participation of the country’s industry regulatory body, Coljuegos, with management staff attending the events to add local and legal insight. Given that the regulator oversaw an 18 percent bump for the industry to US$175 million last year, it’s clear that iGaming in Colombia <a href=# rel=noopener>is thriving under their stewardship</a>, so they’d be a welcomed and sought-after addition to the expo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4.2-A-stacked-agenda-for-Cartagen-Source-unsplash.jpg><p>As for the listed agenda, opening day (Tuesday, April 9) will commence with the Academy meets, which run from 9:00 to 13:00 local time and then from 14:00 to 17:00. That evening, we turn to the first networking event, Fiesta Colombiana GAT 25 Años. Forgivingly, the next event, Exhibición Land Based – Online Gaming, doesn’t start until 14:00 the next day, and that’ll be followed by another networking event, Cóctel de Bienvenida (welcome cocktails), from 22:00.</p><p>On Thursday, it’s another 14:00 start for the Exhibición Land Based – Online Gaming showcase. It’ll run until 21:00 without a scheduled networking event in the evening. Instead, a third and final chance to do some networking will get underway at 10:00 on Friday, April 12. Over at the Pao Pao Beach Club, those still in attendance can continue to network through to 17:00 that afternoon.</p><p>If you ever needed an excuse to get over to Colombia’s Caribbean Coast, the GAT Expo 2024 Cartagena might just present the perfect one!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLSiwIyer6mnXWd9c4CMppijp6JivbO71aKbnqqjYsGwecKoo6ilkp6u</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
