The Midnight Sky star and his beloved have been together since falling in love in 2013.

Not only does the film icon always look happier than ever in <a href=#>photos</a> with his longtime spouse, but George is one to take every opportunity to praise the Lebanese-British barrister.</p><p>The Midnight Sky star and his beloved <a href=#>have been together since falling in love in 2013</a>. George and Amal wed in September 2014, just five months after the Ocean’s Eleven actor got down on one knee and proposed, and they later became the parents of <a href=#>their twins, Alexander and Ella</a>, in June 2017.</p><p>While the famous pair are quite busy with their hectic careers, they always make time for their children and each other. From the moment George became a dad to his little ones, he instantly realized the enormous responsibility he had raising Alexander and Ella.</p><p>“All I know is that I am, at last, experiencing what most people in the world get to experience, which is the incredible amount of love you gain when you have two children you are responsible for,” he <a href=#>told</a> the Daily Mail in September 2017. “I have always felt a great sense of responsibility to other people in the world, but when you have children of your own, you realize you are responsible for their lives in a way you haven’t been before.”</p><p>Despite feeling the pressure to “[be] an example” for his kiddos, George couldn’t feel more blessed since welcoming his babies into his life. Speaking with <a href=#><strong>Hoda Kotb</strong></a> during an appearance on <a href=#>Today</a> in March 2021, the Tomorrowland actor offered an idea of what being a parent truly means to him.</p><p>“[Fatherhood has given me] everything … a sense of belonging and a sense of home and unconditional love — all the things that you were hoping you could get from a really good career and a dog,” he jokingly gushed, before praising the human rights lawyer for changing his outlook. “I met Amal and realized that my life had been pretty empty. And then when you throw these two kids in there, then suddenly you realize how incredibly empty it was.”</p><p>Considering George and Amal are so in love with their adorable twins, it’s hard not to wonder if the two ever plan on expanding their family. Though the <a href=#>Golden Globe</a> winner and the brunette beauty adore parenthood, a friend close to the Hollywood power couple said it doesn’t look like they’ll have more kids.</p><p>“<a href=#>Amal says their hands are full</a>,” the pal exclusively told Closer in January 2019, noting adoption, however, isn’t totally off the table. “They think of the Syrian children that need homes and they get really serious. Bringing home a Syrian refugee child would be a dream fulfilled for Amal.”</p><p><strong>To see a roundup of George’s sweetest quotes about Amal, scroll through the gallery below!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46gnKiql5p6pLjOqKWesaNir6a%2F02aorqekmsBurcGorK1lmJ7AbsPIn5xmmZ2WuXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
