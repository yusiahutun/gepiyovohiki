While Stacey, Steven and Yan all impressed Paul Hollywood so much that they were given a special 'Paul Hollywood handshake', last week's Star Baker, Kate, struggled with her pudding after her custard was too runny.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2c3a5603ff1f-gbbosophie-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eqZvKFhZlxFt data-wc=4><strong>Sophie won Star Baker</strong></p><p id=eskluPl4MBUq data-wc=75>The show then took an unusual turn for the technical challenge, as the bakers were given staggered starts so that they could present their molten peanut butter puddings instantly to the judges, who quietly tried them while the other bakers continued their work. Many bakers fond the challenge tricky, with some bakes either overdone or underdone. Kate once again found herself in trouble by coming last in the technical, while Sophie came out on top.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8eb9b2ced4a4-gbbonoel-fielding-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ee_T6KOz163v data-wc=9><strong>James was the latest contestant to leave the tent</strong></p><p id=eRMlZ277n3IZ><a class=hm-link href=#>See where Great British Bake Off is filmed and how you can visit</a></p><p id=eXJbaJOXu4k_ data-wc=137>For the third challenge, the bakers were tasked with creating a layered trifle, and this challenge arguably showed the most creativity from the judges so far. While Yan wowed with her 'Heart of a Hero' trifle, Steven received a round of applause for his successful American flag jelly. However, it looked like the two-time Star Baker went style over substance for the bake, as both judges complained about the flavour. It was also a tough week for Julia, who failed to impress with her showstopper and worried about going home. However, <a class=hm-link href=#>Noel Fielding revealed </a>that James was the next contestant to leave the tent after he struggled with the three challenges. Meanwhile, Sophie won Star Baker for the first time thanks to her Yuzu bake.
