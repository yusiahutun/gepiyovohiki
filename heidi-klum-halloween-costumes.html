(We mean, the woman hosts an annual star-studded Halloween party, so you know she loves the holiday.) In a 2018 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Klum explained that her <a href=# rel=noopener>love of Halloween</a> stems from her childhood in Cologne, Germany, where she attended the country’s annual Karneval, a famous celebration filled with candy and wild costumes.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>“I embrace that title! And I always want to live up to it, year after year,” Klum said at the time of her Halloween Queen title. “When I moved to America, I immediately fell in love with Halloween and the spookiness of it. All that was missing was a fantastic party. It felt like a real opportunity for me.”</p><p>So how does she pull off her Halloween costumes each year? Well, Klum told THR that she starts thinking of <a href=# rel=noopener>next year’s costume</a> the day after Halloween. “I start thinking about it on Nov. 1! I usually have two or three ideas that I’m playing with and then I decide on one thing. You have to decide at one point because pieces have to be built and all of that,” she said. “So right when the party is over, the morning of Nov. 1, I start thinking, ‘Maybe next year, I’m going to do that one that I didn’t do this year.’ And then, obviously, throughout the year new things come into my mind because maybe I’ve seen a movie, or I went to a country and was inspired by something I saw there.” Look back on <a href=# rel=noopener>Heidi Klum’s Halloween costumes</a> through the years ahead.</p><p>A version of this article was originally published in 2016.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=heidi-klum-halloween-costume-2023-a-peacock>Heidi Klum Halloween Costume 2023: A Peacock</h2><p>Heidi Klum’s Halloween costume for 2023 was an eye-catching, multi-person peacock. “I was like, ‘How the heck do I top this rain worm?’” Klum said during a dress rehearsal the day before the big reveal, per the New York Times.
