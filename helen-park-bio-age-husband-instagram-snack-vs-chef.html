It was hosted by the two comedians Megan Stalter and Hari Kondabolu and judged by the culinary instructors Helen Park and Ali Bouzari.</span></p><p><span>According to Helen, the show had the best contestants and team ever. It was definitely challenging, but given her years of experience, she was able to differentiate the minute difference in taste in the original snacks. It was just as Netflix said, “Not only must they recreate some of the world’s most iconic snacks, they’ll also be challenged to invent their own original snacks inspired by beloved classics. Only one will prevail and claim the $50,000 prize.”</span></p><p><span>Promoting the show, Helen took it to her Linkedin to write, “SNACK vs CHEF – watch these great contestants go head to head with iconic snacks! Check out the set! Join in the fun! #snackvschef Netflix. Hosted by snack-loving comedians Meg Stalter and Hari Kondabolu with judges Ali Bouzari and me!”</span></p><p><span>Also, she posted a pic with her cast member on IG, captioned, “Don’t forget to watch SNACK VS CHEF on @netflix next Wednesday 11/30 as 12 food pros go up against iconic, machine manufactured, SNACKS!”</span></p><p><b>Spoilers Alert: </b><span>Two finalists in the final episode were <a href=#>Lauryn Bodden</a> and Sandy Dee Hall. While both chefs created amazing meals, Lauryn triumphed over her rivals to win the prize money and the coveted title.</span></p><p><span>Judge Ali emphasized that the finalists had to make a snack that was influenced by what they had discovered during the competition and utilize it to hone their own magical component. However, the judge did add that they were free to prepare their own snack, though.</span></p><p><span>So, the finalists took four hours to prepare the dish with Lauryn preparing cavatelli amatriciana (a kind of pasta) in snack-sized form. The recipe was made in bite-size shape after Lauryn drew inspiration from her love of the traditional Italian dish.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Naturally, her dish gained excellent feedback from Helen and Ali. They praised her for the flavor profile and the use of bacon, an animal flavor with savory and light elements that they believed was essential for reinventing the snacking sector.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Sandy made an innovative snack and create a healthy version of chips and popcorn. But sadly, Helen didn’t find it up to par.</span></p><p><span>Eventually, Lauryn was named the winner of </span><i><span>Snack Vs. Chef</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Helen Park Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Helen Park flaunted a net worth of under $900 thousand by 2022 — all thanks to her time as a Culinary chef.</span></p><p><span>The </span><i><span>Snack Vs.
