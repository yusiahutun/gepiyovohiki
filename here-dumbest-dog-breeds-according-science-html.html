class=mol-para-with-font>In the landmark work, he ranked 130 breeds from brightest to dumbest, placing them in five different categories.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Rankings for the book were based on surveys of more than 200 dog obedience judges across the US and Canada.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Here's officially the top 10 dumbest pooches, according to his results.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold sciencetech-ccox mol-style-medium">AFGHAN HOUND&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Afghan Hounds have been famous for their elegant beauty, with a thick, silky, flowing coat and a hairstyle that Paris Hilton would be jealous of.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But just like Hilton, the breed is not renowned for its intelligence; experts at the American Kennel Club (AKC) call it 'a special breed for special people'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Afghan Hound has particularly low 'obedience intelligence', a term that refers to the ability to learn from humans.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to Professor Coren, the breed needed more than 80 repetitions from a trainer to understand a new command.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The breed also obeyed on the first command less than 25 per cent of the time.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Afghan Hound is primarily a type of hunting dog called a sighthound, which means they were bred to hunt using adept speed and eyesight.</p><img id=i-f6c7ba689bb8fee8

their tails for agile movements such as running and jumping.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, a study from experts at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart shows this is not the case.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They found dog tails are used for communication - most commonly using a positive tail wag as a social cue for friendliness, and for batting off pests such as flies.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><a style=font-weight:700 class=class href=#>Read more</a>&nbsp;</p>&lt;!- - ad:

class=mol-para-with-font>So perhaps the ability to learn commands was never part of its genetic or evolutionary make-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold sciencetech-ccox mol-style-medium">BASENJI</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another breed of hunting dog called the&nbsp;Basenji ranked second, meaning it is also not so adept at correctly responding to human commands.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Basenji is not known for its obedience, and would sooner be found burning off energy and causing havoc by chewing furniture when left to its own devices.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 'cat-like' Basenji has high energy levels, does not like being left alone and can often be highly destructive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, this breed is frequently described as intelligent in other respects, such as in its ability to make decisions that follow its own interests, such as gaining food.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to AKC, the&nbsp;Basenji is fastidious and will groom itself much like a cat does&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Basenji is possibly best known for not being able to bark; instead it makes an odd sound somewhere between a yodel and a chortle.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This breed also has a high prey drive, meaning it will chase after cats, squirrels and other smaller animals without a second's warning.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-83e407c4a6ac8ef1

class=mol-para-with-font>The Bulldog has long been a symbol of British national spirit, but its intelligence is on a par with its attractiveness – both quite low.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Professor Coren ranked the breed third from bottom in terms of its ability to obey the first command or understand new commands.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Generally, Bulldogs can be stubborn and will only learn a few commands, so owners are advised to choose carefully when attempting to train them.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Vets have previously warned that the bulldog is riddled with painful diseases and deformities, largely due to centuries of inbreeding.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-abc444d5845e3377

strength and tenacity</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was originally developed as a muscular and athletic dog, but has now been bred as a companion animal with a short skull and protruding jaw.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Bulldog has a reputation for being lazy, but the breed enjoys and benefits from regular exercise.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold sciencetech-ccox mol-style-medium">CHOW CHOW</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Chow Chow's&nbsp;distinctive traits include a lion's-mane-type ruff around the head and shoulders and a tchick, bushy fur coat.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Chow Chow originally hails from China, where it was historically bred for its meat and fur, according to Professor Coren.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-b9513686f6eac8f5

class=imageCaption>The Chow Chow (pictured) is known for its 'bear-like' appearance thanks to its thick fur coat</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But it's developed a reputation for being a bit simple;&nbsp;Professor Coren said 'there is probably furniture out there that is more trainable than chows'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to a report in the Guardian in 2003, a Chow Chow was badly injured when it leaped from a second-floor window in Lancashire after being startled by a plane.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold sciencetech-ccox mol-style-medium">BORZOI&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Next up is the Borzoi, which American Kennel Club describes as 'independent and sometimes stubborn', meaning training will again be a challenge.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, they are known for their&nbsp;gentle and graceful nature, earning the nickname 'the aristocrat of dogs'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>AKC says: 'In their quiet, catlike way they can be stubborn, and training is best accomplished with patience, consistency, and good humour.'&nbsp;</p><img

has long, wrinkled face with loose skin and flapping ears.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 'docile' breed is also relentless and stubborn when it comes to following scents, which they will do so over miles of punishing terrain.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It's possible that this trait makes it particularly prone to getting distracted from obedience tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Other dogs at the bottom of Professor Coren's list are the Shih Tzu, Basset Hound, Mastiff, Beagle and Pekingese.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meanwhile, he ranked the Border Collie as the brightest, followed by the Poodle and the German Shepherd.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-22f98b6212fe5d9d

commands.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Professor Coren also said the dogs tested in the Helsinki study would have ranked in the top 20 per cent for working&nbsp;and obedience
