When he was little, his mother would call him “Sanmao” – “a common way Shanghai people called their kids”, explains Hung.</p>It is often emphasised in his biographical note that his paternal grandparents were Hung Chung-ho, a prolific director in the 1930s and 40s, and Chin Tsi-ang, one of the first female action stars of Chinese-language cinema and an evergreen actress who continued to appear in films until the early 2000s (including in <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Wong Kar-wai</span></a>’s <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">In the Mood for Love</span></a>) – even though Hung didn’t have a chance to see them work when he was a child.Instead, some of Hung’s earliest memories of filmmaking come from his maternal grandfather, a props designer who would take him along to film sets to help out on small tasks, and who, far more consequentially, would later send nine-year-old Sammo to Yu Jim-yuen’s Hong Kong-China Opera Institute to study <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Peking opera</span></a> for the next seven years.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/12/b4109749-c78e-4ff9-8023-00e434147382_4db14e47.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The change of scenery seemed like a good fit for the boy: he was struggling to complete his Primary 2 school year for the third time, while frequently getting into trouble on the streets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Yu’s stern, disciplinarian approach to teaching and readiness to resort to a near-sadistic level of corporal punishment turned the wayward child’s life into a living hell.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As Hung and his fellow survivors would later say, it was an extremely common experience to have been beaten on the buttocks by their sifu, or master, with a rattan cane.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When I ask Hung to describe the single most unforgettable aspect of his training days, he says that quite often, Yu would punish all the students when only one of them had done something bad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/12/c2e83738-baa1-4d22-a0e8-74e79039c2ec_6c3a0300.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In one episode, after Hung had run away from the school for three days and his fellow student Yuen Wah was caught secretly helping him, the latter was beaten 70 times with a cane, and became one of Hung’s best friends in life.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I still have a scar on the top of my head from those days,” says Hung, before explaining how one of Yu’s exercises required his young protégés to hold a handstand for more than an hour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Hung was “13 or 14”, he says, with his “two feet leaning on a wall, I was standing with my two hands on a wooden bench for one and a half hours. It’s no joke, you know?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“At some point, I was completely exhausted. I fell down and my head hit the bench.

Meanwhile, he and his fellow apprentices – including <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Jackie Chan</span></a>, Yuen Wah, Yuen Biao, Corey Yuen Kwai and several others – would become renowned for their performances under the troupe name Seven Little Fortunes, which first came about when they were booked for a nightclub show.Their stories from this time were most notably recounted in the 1988 biographical drama Painted Faces, directed by <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Alex Law Kai-yui</span></a>. Hung was invited by Law to play Yu, his sifu, in the leading role, and he won the second of his two best-actor prizes at the Hong Kong Film Awards for the part. (His previous was for 1982’s Carry on Pickpocket, which he also directed.)Hung used to feel indignant at Yu’s approach but nowadays, he has only respect for his late master, apparent in his short film “Exercise”, which was included as part of the 2020 anthology feature <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Septet: The Story of Hong Kong</span></a>.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/12/2707111e-5e4d-4bbb-8059-3c374d169710_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In it, the filmmaker cast his own son, Timmy Hung Tin-ming, to play Yu, and presented what can only be described as a rose-tinted view of his coming-of-age period.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have many stories – too many – from our training days,” says Hung. “It’s only after the fact that you could see the silver lining.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Sammo Hung started working</strong> as a stuntman in films at the age of 14, and finished his apprenticeship under Yu and became a full-time performer at 16.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Shaw Brothers production The Golden Sword (1969) marked his first credit as a martial arts choreographer, after Han Ying-chieh – Yu’s son-in-law and Hung’s mentor on his early film shoots – dropped out of the project.</p>I’ll keep doing my own thing and continue to realise the ideas that I’ve come up withSammo HungHung had the good fortune to meet <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">King Hu</span></a>, the visionary filmmaker, early.
