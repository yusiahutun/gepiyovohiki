We lather fancy serums, masks, and moisturizers onto our faces only to stop short of our necks. But experts say this is a big mistake. For instance, not wearing SPF on your neck can contribute to neck lines — not to mention, premature signs of aging. And while neck lines are totally normal, certain lifestyle adjustments can help to keep them at bay. We tapped skincare experts Dr. Joshua Zeichner and Dr. Morgan Rabach to find out more.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Joshua Zeichner</a>, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist and the director of cosmetic and clinical research of dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.</li><li>Morgan Rabach, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist at&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>LM Medical NYC</a>.</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From causes to treatment methods to preventative measures, keep reading for our complete guide to understanding neck lines.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-neck-lines></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are Neck Lines?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Neck lines are caused by a combination of natural aging and the daily activities we engage in. "Horizontal lines on your neck are caused by the same factors that cause wrinkles on other areas of your face," says Dr. Zeichner. "Weakening of the skin foundation, along with constriction of muscles under the skin, lead to skin folding and wrinkles that over time will stick around even at rest."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-causes-of-neck-lines></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Causes of Neck Lines</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Most signs of aging are a natural process, but when it comes to neck lines, all of the time you spend scrolling through your Instagram feed isn't helping. "The more we engage in activities that lead to the folding of the skin, the earlier lines and wrinkles will start to set in," explains Dr. Zeichner. "The increased use of mobile devices has led to a phenomenon known as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tech neck</a>. We are bending our heads down and folding the skin on the neck now more than ever. It is likely that this has contributed to the increase in neck wrinkles that we are seeing even in younger patients."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have more neck lines than other people, it doesn't necessarily mean that you're spending more time on your phone than they do; other factors influence how your neck ages, such as sun damage, smoking, and skin tone. "If the skin is damaged, then collagen and elastin are not functioning optimally and the skin cannot resist wrinkling or bounce back from folding the way that it should," Dr. Zeichner says. "People with lighter skin tend to be more susceptible to environmental aging and develop wrinkles at an earlier age than those with darker skin types."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-prevent-neck-lines></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Prevent Neck Lines</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to elevating your tech devices so you aren't constantly bending your neck, Dr. Zeichner suggests using the appropriate skincare products in your routine that will help prevent them. "Especially creams that have active ingredients like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>retinols</a>, sunscreens, peptides, growth factors, and your alpha hydroxy acids," says Dr. Rabach. "The best trick is to use any creams that you use on your face morning and evening on your neck as well," she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You'll want to make healthy lifestyle choices as well; namely, staying hydrated, getting quality sleep, adopting a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>healthy diet</a>, and applying sunscreen daily, Dr. Rabach tells us. "These all really affect neck skin quality over time."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-get-rid-of-neck-lines></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Get Rid of Neck Lines</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've already got some horizontal lines on your neck — or you're noticing a few forming — there are steps you can take to minimize their appearance. According to our experts, this can include both at-home treatments and in-office procedures.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Use Anti-Aging Products</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The skin on the neck is among the thinnest, making it more susceptible to environmental damage. To treat existing lines at home, Dr. Zeichner says it's important to apply products on your neck in addition to your face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the morning, he suggests using products with antioxidant protection, along with sunscreen. Combine two steps in one with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>EltaMD's UV Daily Tinted Broad-Spectrum SPF 40</a>. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>mineral sunscreen</a> includes antioxidant protection, brightening niacinamide, and doesn't leave a white cast.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At night, he recommends a repairing, retinol-based cream formulated for the face, neck, and chest such as <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>RoC's Multi Correction 5-in-1 Anti-Aging Chest, Neck, & Face Cream</a>, which can help stimulate collagen.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: When You Apply Sunscreen in Your Skincare Routine Actually Matters A Lot</strong></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Invest in Red Light Therapy</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Red light therapy has many benefits from mitigating muscle pain to improving an array of skin issues including signs of aging. While the neck area can be difficult to reach, some at-home masks — like the Higher Dose <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Red Light Neck Enhancer</a> — are designed to target texture, skin tone, and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on the neck.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Smooth with Lasers</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Laser therapy is one in-office treatment that derms recommend for neck lines. Dr. Rabach is a huge fan of preventative therapy and ablative lasers. In-office, lasers can be used to stimulate collagen and strengthen the skin foundation.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Target with Microneedling</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Microneedling is another option. Also known as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>derma rolling</a>, Dr. Rabach recommends the treatment to combat neck lines. It involves puncturing the skin with tiny needles<strong> </strong>to promote collagen and elastin production to target everything from fine lines and wrinkles to hair loss.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Soften with Botox</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Rabach also loves to use <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Botox</a> in the neck line. The injection can help relax the muscles under the skin to prevent lines from forming. Just keep in mind that it's not a permanent fix. "When the effect of Botox wears off, the neck muscles will start to constrict again and re-fold the skin," explains Dr. Zeichner. "The effect of Botox typically lasts between three and five months."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Plump with Fillers</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lastly, you can consider fillers, but proceed with caution, Dr. Zeichner says. "Fillers can be injected directly into horizontal lines, however, this is a risky procedure," he says. "Since the skin is so thin, and there is so much movement in the neck, it may lead to lumpiness."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-to-see-a-professional></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When to See a Professional</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've been giving your neck the recommended TLC during your skincare routine but still aren't satisfied with your results, don't despair. According to Dr. Rabach, when over-the-counter topicals aren’t cutting it and you need a prescription-strength cream or procedure, your best bet is to see a dermatologist. They will be able to provide an evaluation and determine a solution that's right for you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1on6ivXZyytXnRoptmp5Ziu6avymajoqaVqA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
