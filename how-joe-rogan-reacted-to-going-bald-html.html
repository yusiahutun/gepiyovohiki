He’s <a href=#>usually straightforward</a> with his guests on The Joe Rogan Experience and makes no bones about his personal beliefs. Despite that, it seems Rogan is <a href=#>just as susceptible</a> to vanity as the rest of us. When the podcaster discovered he was going bald, he wound up having a reaction that some fans might not have expected.&nbsp;</p><h2>Show business was Joe Rogan’s first concern&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-2_34>At the time Joe Rogan started balding, he wasn’t podcasting yet. He was still mostly working on television, and so he worried about how going bald might affect his career on the small screen.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_63>During an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience he explained, “My hair was falling out, I was freaking out. I was freaking out when my hair was falling out cause I was on TV too, and I was making a living like, as an actor at the time on NewsRadio. And I thought like, oh my god, my f*cking hair is falling out.”</p><p id=par-4_70>Rogan started taking a medication to try and keep it from falling out for a while, but apparently that wasn’t enough to keep it on his head. “I knew it was falling out for a while. I saved it though, with Minoxidil, and the Minixodil was hanging in there. But after a while, it was still falling out. I was like, god I gotta do something about it,” he added.</p><h2>Joe Rogan went for hair transplants</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joe.rogan_.22.jpg><p id=par-5_39>Eventually, Joe Rogan had enough of balding and decided that it was time to go in for hair transplants. The comedian figured that if the medicine wasn’t going to work, he might as well give the transplants a shot.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_45>However, the comedian wound up dissatisfied with the end result. It seems it wasn’t very convincing. Rogan explained, “It didn’t look good. I never looked at my hair and went, ‘Yeah!’ It was always like, oh I guess I got hair up there now, whatever.”</p><p id=par-7_118>Rogan wound up with a scar on the back of his head as a result of the hair transplant. Be that as it may, he claims he’d still rather have the scar than the transplant. He said, “You know, the way they do it is like a single thing, and it’s not like the old way of doing it. But they take a big strip of hair, so I like, have this big scar on the back of my head like a smile for the rest of my life. But I would rather have that. Because first of all it’s like a good public service announcement. Like if you’re thinking about doing this just look at my head.”</p><h2>He prefers going bald</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joe.rogan_.23.jpg><p id=par-8_35>The comedian isn’t feeling particularly lost without his head of hair, however. In fact, he thinks that going bald is the best look for him, especially given the state of the hair he has left.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_54>“I like having a shaved head, it’s so easy. I got a good head for it. I look better with a shaved head. I look better with a shaved head than I did. Especially with the ahir that I have left. It’s just all sad hair, just sick hair,” he said on his <a href=#>podcast</a>.</p><p id=par-10_61>On a different episode, he told fans, “I should never have done anything. I should have shaved my head from the beginning. And so whenever kids ask me online, like dudes ask me, ‘I’m freaking out I’m only 18 and I’m losing my hair.’ Shave it b*tch, just deal with that. Just accept the fact that you don’t have any hair.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sMOMo6aeZaKktKK6jKucmpukmrFuwM5mnqihnpx6o63LnWWhrJ2hfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
