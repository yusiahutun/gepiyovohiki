For a breakdown on how to apply your eye cream of choice, we consulted top professionals for a step-by-step guide, as well as their tips on where to include eye cream in your skincare routine.</p><h2 data-node-id title="Wash your face." data-anchor-id=wash-your-face class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">Wash your face.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As with any form of skincare, starting with a fresh, clean face is key. Use your favorite cleanser or balm to remove lingering dirt, oil, and makeup ahead of moisturizing.</p><h2 data-node-id title="If applicable, apply toner and serum." data-anchor-id=if-applicable-apply-toner-and-serum class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">If applicable, apply toner and serum.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you use toner and serum, apply them ahead of your eye cream. According to experts, each of these aids in helping prepare your skin to absorb the product more effectively.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related:</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id title="Start with a small amount of cream." data-anchor-id=start-with-a-small-amount-of-cream class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">Start with a small amount of cream.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Since eye creams are packed with potent ingredients like caffeine, hyaluronic acid, and peptides, a pea-size amount is usually plenty to cover both eyes.

Gently pat the cream in using a pouncing motion. While quality ingredients are key, what is equally important is how an eye cream is applied.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Under-eyes are easily irritated, as too much tugging and rubbing can quickly lead to redness and inflammation, especially if your skin is already dehydrated. However, it’s important to keep in mind that skincare changes won’t happen overnight. “The eye creams may not lead to instant results, so consistent use may be required to see these more long-term benefits,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/g43798071/best-eye-creams-for-dark-circles/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=notes class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">notes</a> board-certified dermatologist <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/gloria-lin-md-ms-faad/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gloria Lin" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Gloria Lin</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id title="Focus on your product placement." data-anchor-id=focus-on-your-product-placement class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">Focus on your product placement.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Be sure to dab along the orbital bone, which is just beneath the eye and extends from its inner corner outward past its outer corner.</p><h2 data-node-id title="Avoid direct contact with your eyes." data-anchor-id=avoid-direct-contact-with-your-eyes class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">Avoid direct contact with your eyes.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Professionals advise being extra careful not to apply an eye cream too close to your lashes, as doing so may cause irritation. “Be aware that contact hypersensitivity reactions are delayed, so symptoms may develop five to seven days after exposure to an offending product,” board-certified dermatologist <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/drblairrose/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Blair Murphy-Rose" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Blair Murphy-Rose</a> told Bazaar <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/g44939896/best-caffeine-eye-creams/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=recently class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">recently</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id title="Allow the eye cream to fully absorb." data-anchor-id=allow-the-eye-cream-to-fully-absorb class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1">Allow the eye cream to fully absorb.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Wait a few minutes to allow the eye cream to fully absorb before applying moisturizer or makeup. Applying eye cream in the morning can help reduce puffiness while providing a smoother base for makeup.
