  What Does a Podcast Editor Do?  First, you need to understand what a podcast is.

A podcast is an audio program you can stream or download from the internet using your device. Audio podcasts integrate artistic sound production with spontaneous or scripted discussions on a specific topic or theme. You can also create video podcasts, but we'll focus on audio podcasting in this article.</p><p>Podcast audio editors use a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), a fancy way to say podcast editing software. As a podcast editor, you'll manipulate raw audio files using DAW to enhance the podcast. You'll ensure that each podcast episode is clean and has a clear narrative and natural content flow. Your ultimate goal is to create a compelling story for your listeners.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A podcast audio editor may focus on one or more aspects of podcasting, or do all of these:</p><ul><li><strong>Recording:</strong> Capturing sounds using electronic devices.</li><li><strong>Content editing:</strong> Removing audio elements to make your podcast flow naturally.</li><li><strong>Sound designing:</strong> Weaving music tracks and sound effects into the audio track.</li><li><strong>Mixing:</strong> Balancing all the audio elements in your podcast (making sure that each element is not too loud or soft) and creating emotion.</li><li><strong>Mastering:</strong> Polishing and enhancing your audio track to make it sound professional.</li><li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Adding podcast show notes; uploading and promoting online.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-become-a-podcast-editor>How to Become a Podcast Editor</h2><p>Podcast editors need to build their technical skills through practice or experience. If you don't end up employed or becoming a freelancer, you can try being a content creator. You'll know which path to take as you go along. Here are some tips to get you started.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=learn-online-or-find-a-mentor>1. Learn Online or Find a Mentor</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kenny-eliason-y_6rqstqbyq-unsplash.jpg><p>You can self-learn podcast editing by watching YouTube videos or taking an online course. However, the process becomes simpler to understand if you can have a mentor guide you through the steps. With a mentor, you'll be able to ask questions on <a href=#>how to make great podcasts</a>. Learning becomes easier since you can receive timely feedback for your mistakes.</p><h3 id=practice-content-editing>2. Practice Content Editing</h3><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beginners usually start with content editing. Content editing improves your ability to spot undesirable elements in a podcast and familiarizes you with DAW features. It's one of the most basic skills you need to master as a podcast editor.</p><p>You can start with what The Podcast Host calls the Minimum Effective Editing method or MEE. First, trim or tidy up the start and end of the audio track. Second, normalize it or make the sound regular. Once you master this, read up on the <a href=#>podcasting mistakes you need to avoid</a>.</p><h3 id=invest-in-your-workspace-and-equipment>3. Invest in Your Workspace and Equipment</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/nubelson-fernandes-3p2dfdm4-lm-unsplash.jpg><p>A quiet work area is an absolute must-have in podcast editing. You'll have to ensure you catch mistakes, hisses, and other background noises in your podcast. Create a dedicated space where you'll have the minimum amount of distraction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also, invest in noise-canceling headphones. You don't have to buy the most expensive one. You can survey the <a href=#>best cheap noise-canceling headphones that are affordable</a>.</p><p>When it comes to your computer, you can use any laptop or PC that's fast enough to handle your podcast editing software or DAW. It doesn't have to be the quickest or the highest performing on the market. Mid-range laptops will already work well when you're only starting.</p><h3 id=choose-your-podcast-editing-software>4. Choose Your Podcast Editing Software</h3><p>The DAW is your virtual recording studio. You can choose from a handful of paid and free options:</p><p>The most popular one for beginners is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Audacity</a>, which is free to download on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Audacity is simple to navigate yet powerful enough to create quality podcasts. With some guidance and practice, you'll be able to master its most basic features.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're a Mac user, you can also use the beginner-friendly GarageBand. GarageBand comes free with every Mac computer. To know which is better, check out <a href=#>GarageBand vs. Audacity: The Best Music Production Software Compared</a>.</p><p>Once you level up, you can check out the DAWs, such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Audition</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reaper</a>. Audition costs $20.99 monthly, but you can explore its features during the free trial. Like Audacity, Reaper is a cross-platform DAW. However, it has more advanced features. It's free to try for 60 days, but you'd have to pay $60 for a discounted license or $225 for a commercial license.</p><h3 id=listen-to-high-quality-podcasts>5. Listen to High-Quality Podcasts</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3767420.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spotify hosts many quality podcasts. For example, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Plain English With Derek Thompson</a> takes current events and turns them into thought-provoking commentaries. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dust by Gunpowder & Sky</a> is an anthology of gripping narratives that take you through immersive science fiction worlds.</p><p>Listening improves your ear for quality podcasts. What made the podcast compelling? What could have been done better? What are reviewers saying? Take note of best practices you can apply in your work.</p><h3 id=download-quot-free-quot-music>6. Download "Free" Music</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/soundstripe-website.jpg><p>Most music is not free because you need to pay or attribute the creators. Public domain music, which has an expired copyright, is the only free option. However, most public-domain music was created decades ago. While it's hard to find free music, you can get them for less than the price or under certain conditions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Royalty-free music sites like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Soundstripe</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">PremiumBeat</a> pay for the licensing for you, so you can use the music as much as you want. You only need to pay for a monthly or yearly subscription to download music and sound effects for commercial use.</p><p>Another option would be to use music with a Creative Common License. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Free Music Archive</a> has a great selection of music. You might also score some rare musical finds. Make sure you read the conditions before using a track, so you know if you need to attribute the author or ask for permission.</p><p>If you need old public domain music, browse the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Domain Review</a>, which hosts many tracks and other media. Another excellent option is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Music Archive</a>, which curates out-of-copyright music.</p><p>Adding music to your podcast will cost a little time and effort. However, appropriate music spices up your show. Sound effects or background music can make your podcast more compelling, while a good intro can set the tone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=volunteer-for-podcast-editing-roles>7.

You can ask for podcast editing volunteer opportunities in nonprofits, churches, and podcast shows.</p><p>Job sites such as LinkedIn or Glassdoor might also yield some results. Another option would be to sign up on volunteer sites such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Catchafire</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Idealist</a>, which connects volunteers with nonprofits.</p><h3 id=create-your-work-samples>8.

Describe the project goal, the tools that you used, and your process.</p><p>Once you create your samples, upload them on a site like SoundCloud or Google Drive. You can then share links to your work with potential employers. Remember to listen to your audio before giving out links!</p><p>Alternatively, you can create a more visually appealing portfolio on sites like Canva.
