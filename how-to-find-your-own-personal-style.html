Growing up, I was very concerned about blending in with my surroundings, so for a chunk of time, my outfits could best be described as "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Staten Island Italian — Teen Edition</a>." Even when I began working in the fashion industry, I struggled to find a sense of style that truly represented&nbsp;me&nbsp;and not what I thought I was supposed to be. I splurged on clothes I could barely afford and couldn't quit trying to re-create whatever "It" trend I had spotted on the runway.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I'm not sure when I made the switch, but part of finding my own personal style was by accident. For a while, I suffered from folliculitis, and I'd often wake up to hundreds of tiny pimples all over my neck, chest, and back. Panicked, I would grab a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bandana</a>&nbsp;or scarf in order to hide my breakout, and it soon became a styling trick I couldn't quit. The line between wearing this piece out of necessity and wearing it intentionally became blurred, and I liked that I had my own signature look rather than hopping on whatever was "in."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>@samathasutton / Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The cumulative effect of all of that is I've landed on a personal style — a uniform made up of only the pieces I seriously love, regardless of what everyone else was wearing. However, I won't say that it's not an ongoing process. Finding your own style means evolving with it over time, and my tastes are constantly changing. Whenever I'm feeling a little lost, or my closet starts looking chaotic, I turn to a few tricks to get me back on track.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you're at step one of developing your own sense of style or just in need of a refresh, here are seven tips for making sure your wardrobe is working for you.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-reconsider-trends></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Reconsider Trends</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I cover trends every single day as part of my job, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted to shop them all. When I found myself searching for&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>carrot-leg jeans</a>, I had to stop and ask myself some serious questions. Was this lust inspired by hours of looking at and talking about this questionable shape, or was it actual love?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I decided they didn't bring me the same joy as my&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>go-to mom jeans</a>, so I skipped that one (and saved some money). It should be a no-brainer, but it's important to consider what&nbsp;you&nbsp;personally like versus what your favorite celebrities or influencers are wearing. You can always appreciate a trend from afar without forcing it into your own wardrobe or look.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-forget-the-rules></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Forget the "Rules"</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>@samanthasutton / Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I think a lot of finding my personal style has been reassessing what I thought I could and couldn't wear. For instance, my whole life, I never felt like a "Dr. Martens person" because I associated those shoes with more of a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rock star aesthetic</a>; however, my white platform Chelsea boots ended up being the pair I wore with everything.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You don't have to be X, Y, or Z to fit into a specific box in order to incorporate something into your wardrobe (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>age included</a>!), and it doesn't have to be a certain season or occasion to wear the items you love. If you keep looking at that one piece with a strong yearning, wishing you could pull it off, I'd encourage you to try it. That may be the key to unlocking a style profile that feels off-limits but really isn't.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-consider-the-core-of-your-wardrobe></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Consider the Core of Your Wardrobe</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>@samanthasutton / Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Something else that really helped me develop a personal style was finding items I knew I could rely on every day, which weren't necessarily on-trend but brought me joy. It's how I would describe my previous relationship with bandanas, but then it became puff sleeves, ruffles, and polka dots. People I worked with even jokingly (and lovingly) called my sense of style "Fashion Clown" because I tended to gravitate toward pieces that featured those details and wore them all the time. Even when I style celebrity photo shoots, I can't escape adding white boots or sneakers. It's my personal choice because I think a neutral shoe looks great with everything.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Think about the versatile pieces you yourself can't quit, then style your outfits around them. If you're already gravitating toward Birkenstocks, don't just save them for casual days. Pair them with dresses and jeans, or experiment by adding some socks to your look. If you love wearing&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>button-downs</a>, use them as sweaters, layer them under overalls, or wear them as cover-ups. Soon, these staples will become your signature pieces, aka something people immediately associate with you in a positive way.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Stacy London</h3><p>"I would try putting things on together that were ridiculous, that totally didn't belong together, but out of that came some amazing magic."</p><p>— Stacy London</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-play-dress-up-with-your-own-clothes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Play Dress-Up with Your Own Clothes</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>@samanthasutton / Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Is there something you own and love but you never wear because you don't have the 'straight off a mannequin' ideal outfit to put it in? Maybe there's a different way to wear that piece you haven't thought of yet, and it can work with what you already own. Former stylist and TV personality Stacy London revealed to&nbsp;InStyle&nbsp;in 2021 that she&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>became reacquainted with her wardrobe</a>&nbsp;this way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I spent a lot of time in my closet during the pandemic because what else was there to do? And I took it upon myself to play, to take out clothes that I haven't worn in years — maybe they don't fit anymore, maybe it was time to get rid of them,"&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Truth About Style</a>&nbsp;author told us before adding, "But also just play with what I had and experiment, go shopping in my own closet, and look at my clothes through different eyes so that I could come up with something new. I would try putting things on together that were ridiculous, that totally didn't belong together. But out of that came some amazing magic."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-think-less-about-fast-fashion></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Think Less About Fast Fashion</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another trick that helps me spice up my wardrobe is browsing vintage stores or shopping secondhand sites like Etsy, The Real Real, or Depop. With so many decades worth of clothing at my fingertips, I'm much more likely to buy something that I personally love without being influenced by the hot trends of the moment. Maybe I'll find a fun floral dress with ruffled sleeves, inspiring me to type in that search term and shop multiple options, later making that style a major part of my wardrobe (it's happened before!). Plus, it's a great way to embrace&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>throwback-inspired trends</a>&nbsp;while still having clothes and accessories that feel unique and special to you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, you want to make sure these pieces can be worn with your staples (the green shoes you can't stop wearing, your growing collection of chunky earrings, etc.) and that they're items you really do love rather than impulse purchases. However, don't worry so much about putting a label on your style if some of what you buy feels eclectic or "punk" while other items are more basic or "girly." The thing about personal style is that it's just that — personal. So, if you want your thing to be old band tees styled with voluminous skirts, go ahead and do it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The point is to choose wisely. You can buy two to three special, standout items that epitomize&nbsp;you&nbsp;rather than walking out of a mega-store with 14 pieces and end up happier and with more outfit ideas — I promise.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-expensive-doesnt-necessarily-mean-better></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Expensive Doesn't Necessarily Mean Better</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Price has played a significant role in me finding my own personal style. Looking for affordable everyday clothes led me to shop for&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>$13 Gildan sweatshirts</a>&nbsp;and checkered Vans, a classic shoe priced at $40. However, just because it's not expensive doesn't mean you can't make it look the part.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-less-is-more></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Less Is More</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to London, developing your own sense of style is all about asking yourself the right questions: "'How do you make your style work for you in every aspect of your life? How does it bring you joy? How does it have utility in your life and your closet? Do you feel that your closet is a place that is cohesive, or are there big holes so that it's hard for you to wear 80 percent of your wardrobe, and you wear 20 percent of your wardrobe 80 percent of the time?' You want a wardrobe where you wear everything. Where you love everything."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykuM6tn6Kml2S1sMOMraZmnpmjsW7Fzq6pZqeno3qxsdGspqeZnGLAtcXLng%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
