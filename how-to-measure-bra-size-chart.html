This undergarment is one of the trickiest purchases, requiring full knowledge of one’s chest area down to the centimeter. From the sizes of the bust to the back to the cup to the gape, everything needs to be taken into account to provide optimal support. It’s a process that brands take very seriously.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://shop.hanrousa.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Hanro class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Hanro</a>, for example, is issuing a booklet on this singular topic in fall 2020. Authored by Frauke Nagel, the brand’s bra product developer, it is intended to be a complete guide to buying bras. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.laperla.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="La Perla" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">La Perla</a> is also very attentive to this process, having an expert team, which includes global training director Monica Evangelisti and private client manager Brittany Valdez, to make sure that customers leave its store with pieces that fit perfectly. These experts know the dos and don’ts of how to measure bra sizes. They are meticulous in their approach, and they encourage consumers to practice the same due diligence. Ahead, the complete breakdown.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Step 1</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The first thing you need to do is put on a bra. “Size is relative here, since it can vary depending on the brand, material, fit, and finish,” explains Nagel. “The size should only serve as a guide.” Move around and, as the La Perla team instructs, get “an idea of how it feels while you’re wearing it. Take into account how it feels on your body: Does it provide support? Is too loose or too constricting?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nagel adds, “Take your time and keep the bra you are trying on for a few minutes. Move your arms, sit down, and stand up again. Like shoes, bras need to be broken in and will become more comfortable over time. But if it pinches or tugs right away, you should try a different size or style.”</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Step 2</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Have a measuring tape handy. La Perla suggests that isn’t a necessity if you know the size of the bra you’re wearing, but for complete accuracy, it’s best to use this tool. “If you do have a measuring tape, you’ll want to start with your under bust,” says La Perla. “Take your measuring tape, pulling it comfortably taught around your back and meeting at the front directly underneath your breasts, and take note of the closest even number when rounding down. This is your band number.” Nagel also encourages you to “breathe normally” while doing so.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Step 3</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Next, take the tape up and measure your overbust. “Typically, this will be about the middle of your breast,” says the La Perla team. “Take note of this measurement. To determine your cup size, you’ll want to subtract the band size from your bust measurement. For example, if your band was 34 inches and bust was 37 inches, the number you’d get is three. This number will correlate with a cup size starting with the number one, equaling A. If you got a three, your cup size would be C and so on.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Measure your circumference at the fullest part of your bust with your arms down and relaxed,” says Nagel. “We recommend wearing a non-padded bra while taking this measurement. The overbust measurement will tell you your cup size.”</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Step 4</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Check a bra size chart to make sure everything is up to snuff. Here’s one provided by Hanro for reference.</p><img alt="how to measure bra size bra size chart" title="how to measure bra size bra size chart" width=1359 height=742 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hanro-bra-size-chart-1588700767.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Hanro</span></p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Step 5</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You’re not done yet. Now that you have your band and cup sizes, it is important to consider the details. Nagel dissects the other categories that should be considered.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Back: “The back section should sit in a straight line along the rib cage. If the back rides up, try a smaller underbust size.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cups: “If the cups are nice and flat against your breasts, the bra fits perfectly. However, if you notice that the seam is digging in, the cup is too small. If the seam creases or there is a gap between the cup and the breast, the bra is probably too large.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Wire: “The wire should frame the breasts and lie flat against the chest. Make sure that the wire does not press against the soft breast tissue.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Straps: “They should lie firmly on your shoulders without digging into the skin. If they leave pressure marks, you should extend the strap length.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/761da88f-8b46-4ea7-b5eb-85f2d614da1e_1614118190.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Barry Samaha" title="Headshot of Barry Samaha" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Barry Samaha is the former style commerce editor at Esquire, where he covered all things fashion and grooming.
