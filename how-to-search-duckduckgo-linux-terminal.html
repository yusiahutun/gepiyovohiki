Lately, it has gained a lot of popularity among privacy enthusiasts who have been advocating its privacy-friendly search experience to others.</p><p>If you, too, use DuckDuckGo for all your web searches and prefer to use the command line for most of the operations on your computer, ddgr is a useful utility that lets you use the terminal to perform DuckDuckGo queries.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Below is a guide explaining ddgr and the steps to search DuckDuckGo from the Linux command line.</p><h2 id=what-is-ddgr>What Is ddgr?</h2><p>ddgr is a command-line tool that lets you search DuckDuckGo from the terminal. It returns results in the <a href=#>HTML format</a>, and you can navigate through them using your keyboard.</p><p>While the default ddgr interface uses minimal space without sacrificing readability, it does give you the option to customize some of its aspects like the string text, number of results displayed per page, etc. to your preference.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Some of ddgr's notable features include:</p><ul><li>Fast and instantaneous result processing</li><li>Easy navigation</li><li>Support for DuckDuckGo !Bang</li><li>Search result filtering by time, region, etc.</li><li>Browser integration</li><li>HTTPS proxy support</li><li>Do Not Track</li><li>Minimal dependencies</li><li>REPL support for continuous searches</li></ul><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>Does HTTPS Protect Data in Transit?</a></span></p><h2 id=how-to-install-ddgr-on-linux>How to Install ddgr on Linux</h2><p>It's quite easy to get ddgr up and running on your Linux machine. And much like installing other programs on Linux, you can also install ddgr in a few different ways.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>So depending on which distro you're using, follow the instructions in the sections below to install ddgr.</p><h3 id=installing-ddgr-on-debian-ubuntu>Installing ddgr on Debian/Ubuntu</h3><p>Installing ddgr on Debian and its derivates is simple, thanks to the APT package manager. To do this, open the terminal and run the following command:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">sudo apt-get install ddgr</code></pre><p>When prompted, press <strong>y</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong> to continue the installation.</p><p>Another way to install ddgr on Debian-based Linux distros, besides the APT package manager, is using a DEB package file. For this, start by downloading the ddgr DEB package on your computer from the link below.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ddgr (DEB package)</a></p><p>Once done, open the terminal and use <a href=#>the cd command</a> to change the directory to <strong>Downloads</strong> (or the directory where you just downloaded the package).</p><p>Next, run the following command to install the package:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">sudo dpkg -i ddgr_x.x.x-x_ubuntuXX.XX.amd64.deb</code></pre><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>How Do You Install a DEB File in Ubuntu?</a></span></p><h3 id=installing-ddgr-using-snap>Installing ddgr Using Snap</h3><p>Snap offers one of the simplest ways to install a package on Linux. If you're using some Linux distro—other than Debian or its derivates—that doesn't have a package for ddgr in its repositories, you can install ddgr on your system using Snap.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>For this, make sure you have Snap installed on your computer first.</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">snap --version</code></pre><p>If this returns a version number, Snap is present on your machine and you can proceed to the next step. If it doesn't, you'll have to <a href=#>install Snap</a> first.</p><p>Considering you've managed to get Snap on your device, you can install ddgr by running:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">sudo snap install ddgr</code></pre><h2 id=how-to-use-ddgr-to-search-duckduckgo>How to Use ddgr to Search DuckDuckGo</h2><p>Searching DuckDuckGo using ddgr is as simple as performing a couple of simple steps. First, open the terminal since that's where ddgr works. Next, enter your search query in the syntax below to look it up on DuckDuckGo:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">ddgr your_search_query</code></pre><p>For example:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">ddgr makeuseof</code></pre><p>Here's what the output looks like:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ddgr-output.png><h3 id=configuring-the-number-of-returned-results>Configuring the Number of Returned Results</h3><p>Once you make a query, the output will display a list of search results related to your search query.</p><p>By default, ddgr lists only 10 results at a time. However, you can choose to view more/fewer results at a time by explicitly mentioning the number of results you want to see in the following manner:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">ddgr -n x your_search_query</code></pre><p>...where <strong>x</strong> is the number of results you want to view.</p><h3 id=opening-a-link-from-returned-results>Opening a Link From Returned Results</h3><p>Each ddgr result on the list is numbered. This number is called the index of a result, and you can use it to open the corresponding link.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>For instance, if you want to open link number <strong>5</strong> from the results in a browser, simply enter <strong>5</strong> in the omniprompt—the prompt you see in the terminal after you make a query in ddgr—and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</p><h3 id=integrate-ddgr-with-text-based-browsers>Integrate ddgr With Text-Based Browsers</h3><p>By default, ddgr opens links in the default web browser on your Linux machine. However, it also supports a bunch of text-based browsers, such as w3m, lynx, elinks, and www-browser, which you can use to open the search results.</p><p>To set a browser as default, all you need to do is <a href=#>set the environment variable</a> for it. For this, run the following command in a terminal window:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash"><span class=hljs-built_in>export</span> BROWSER=w3m</code></pre><p>Alternatively, if you'd like to use a browser for just a particular query, you can do so using:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">BROWSER=w3m ddgr your_search_query</code></pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ddgr-in-text-based-browser.png><h3 id=do-an-quot-i-39-m-feeling-ducky-quot-search>Do an "I'm Feeling Ducky" Search</h3><p>Just like Google's "I'm Feeling Lucky" search, DuckDuckGo also has its own version of the same, called "I'm Feeling Ducky." In case you're unaware, this option bypasses all the results on the SERP and directly opens the first link in the list.</p><p>With ddgr, you can perform an "I'm Feeling Ducky" search using the following syntax:</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><pre><code class="hljs bash">ddgr -j lucky your_search_query</code></pre><h3 id=do-a-duckduckgo-bang-search>Do a DuckDuckGo !Bang Search</h3><p>As mentioned earlier in the guide, ddgr also supports DuckDuckGo !Bang, which are shortcuts (or short commands) that let you look up your query directly on a website without having to visit it.</p><p>Say you want to learn more about DuckDuckGo on Wikipedia, you can do this easily by running the following command:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">ddgr !w duckduckgo</code></pre><p>If you're on Bash shell, you'll need to escape the <strong>!</strong> character. If you do this, your command would look like this:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">ddgr \!w duckduckgo</code></pre><h3 id=perform-a-website-specific-search>Perform a Website-Specific Search</h3><p>Similar to using DuckDuckGo !Bangs in ddgr, you can also carry out a website-specific search using the <strong>-w</strong> tag. For instance, if you want to look up <a href=#>mechanical keyboards</a> on Amazon, you can do it more efficiently using the command below:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">ddgr -w amazon.com mechanical keyboard</code></pre><h3 id=search-for-a-specific-file-type>Search for a Specific File Type</h3><p>At times, you may just want to find a certain kind of file on the internet. In such instances, ddgr can help you filter out your results by adding the file type in your search query.</p><p>For example, let's say you want to look up image files (PNG) on the DuckDuckGo search engine. With ddgr, you can do this as shown in the command below:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">ddgr duckduckgo filetype:png</code></pre><h3 id=get-help-with-ddgr>Get Help With ddgr</h3><p>At any time, if you're unsure about how to use a ddgr command or would like to learn more, you can <a href=#>get command-line help</a> using:</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><pre><code class="hljs bash">ddgr --<span class=hljs-built_in>help</span></code></pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ddgr-help.png><h2 id=carry-out-searches-on-duckduckgo-more-efficiently>Carry Out Searches on DuckDuckGo More Efficiently</h2><p>With ddgr installed and running on your Linux machine, you can now carry out searches on DuckDuckGo more efficiently without ever having to open DuckDuckGo in a browser.</p><p>ddgr supports a bunch of other operations and customization options than what we've covered in this guide. To check them out, head over to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ddgr's GitHub</a>.</p><p>Besides, if you'd like to get more out of your browsing experience, DuckDuckGo's !Bang feature can come in handy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifqK9dqbxuv8SaqZygXZnCpLfDrpqkn59iuaq61LFkrZ2ioravrcto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
