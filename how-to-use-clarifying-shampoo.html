Ahead, expert advice for adding a clarifying shampoo to your haircare routine.</p><h2 data-node-id=1 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What Are Clarifying Shampoos?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Think of clarifying shampoos as shampoos on steroids—they cut through product buildup and oils to leave your hair super-clean. "Clarifying shampoos are a type of cleansing shampoo specifically formulated to clear buildup and remove the residue of styling products," explains Gregga Prothero, master stylist and founder of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.gregga.la/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gregga LA" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Gregga LA</a>. If you’ve ever had a salon relaxer or keratin treatment done, you’ve probably had one used on you (both treatments perform better on ruthlessly clean hair).</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How Is Clarifying Shampoo Different From Regular Shampoo?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Clarifying shampoo has more cleaning detergent and thus, a higher level of surfactants," explains <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.julienfarel.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Julien Farel" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Julien Farel</a>, creative director and owner of the Julien Farel Restore Salon and Spa, whose newest location is now open in Palm Beach, Florida. While shampoo is, of course, designed to clean hair, it can sometimes create more of an issue. "The more you shampoo, the more your scalp will produce sebum as a natural defense. Then, the more you will have to wash your hair," says Farel. "Clarifying shampoos are made to degrease the hair, the buildup, the oils, and everything on our hair and scalp."</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Who Should Use a Clarifying Shampoo?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Prothero recommends using a clarifying shampoo "if you tend to use a lot of hair products, get a lot of oil buildup, have very hard water, or you’re a swimmer whose hair has a greenish tint from chlorine buildup."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But generally speaking, anyone can use a clarifying shampoo. “These shampoos can be used by anyone, especially if you feel your hair is not cooperating or if it seems a bit lifeless. Those are signs of product buildup,” says hairstylist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.paullabrecque.com/pages/about-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Paul Labrecque" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Paul Labrecque</u></a> of Paul Labrecque Salon and Spa. “Think of clarifying your hair as preparing your canvas for something new.”</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">When Should You Use Clarifying Shampoo?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like any serious hair product, there is a right time and a wrong time to break out the heavy-duty shampoo. "You shouldn't use one more than once a month," advises celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://instagram.com/mararoszak/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mara Roszak" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Mara Roszak</u></a>, who recommends not washing your hair more than every other day the rest of the time. This is because hardcore hair cleansing comes with a catch: Because clarifying shampoos do such a good job of purging hair of any and every trace of buildup and gunk, your natural oils (which keep your hair shiny and your scalp happy) can also get whisked away. Therefore, you don't want to overdo it, and risk over-drying hair.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Is Clarifying Shampoo Good for Your Hair?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yes—as long as you don't overdo it. "Clarifying shampoo helps to remove excess buildup, but using it too much can reverse the health of the hair and scalp," explains Farel. "Using a clarifying shampoo more than once a month can leave your hair feeling dry and dull, and will create flyaways and frizz." In addition, the higher level of surfactants can strip away dye and natural oils. "With color-treated hair, it can change the shade of the color and remove all moisture," explains Farel. To keep this from happening, make sure to choose a color-safe formula, and only swap in the clarifying formula as directed.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How to Use a Clarifying Shampoo</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Think of your monthly clarifying session as a true beauty treatment. Set out a decent chunk of shower time to devote to the process. Start by focusing the shampoo on your roots, where buildup tends to be worse. Channel your inner salon shampoo station and really work those suds in (a little bonus scalp massage is never a bad thing), progressively spreading the shampoo through the length of your hair as you go. Rinse, then follow up with conditioner. Or, even better, a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/hair/advice/g4587/nourishing-hair-masks/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hair mask" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>hair mask</u></a> to restore all of that lost moisture and up your gloss game. And remember, don't use more than directed: "Over-clarifying your hair can lead to dryness, flake on your scalp and eventually hurt the life cycle of your hair," says Farel.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below, a handful of the best clarifying shampoos to help you take that first, deep-cleansing step.</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>The Best Clarifying Shampoos<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqGZmad8on2QamlxZ5ikxG7AzmasrJ1dmLmivsifsKKml2LAqa3MqaaoZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
