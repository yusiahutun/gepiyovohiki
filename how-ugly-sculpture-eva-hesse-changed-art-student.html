Hong Kong contemporary sculptor Leelee Chan tells Richard Lord how it changed her life.</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like Eva Hesse, I started off as a painter: we’re really similar. This was the first Eva Hesse piece I encountered, when I was an undergraduate student in the painting department of the Art Institute of Chicago, in 2004.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I always walked through the museum to get to my classes. There was a small section of contemporary art, and I remember seeing her work for the first time; I had seen her name in an art history book before, but nothing else. At that time I only knew people like Van Gogh and Dali – I didn’t even known Jackson Pollock – so my understanding of the work was minimal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/24/3663b524-e787-4c97-a106-4593f1a9f67b_8d200785.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s made from a bedsheet, with a steel tube extending from it; the steel is industrial, but with a bedsheet, which is personal. The frame we use to stretch canvases is used as a hanging device. It’s like a painting but it’s not a painting. It asks: what is a sculpture and what is a painting?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For me, seeing this work in a museum was shocking. I didn’t like it, I didn’t understand it and I didn’t know how to look at it. I wondered why they would have something so ugly in a museum. But it also made me want to find out more. I realised that art can be subversive – it was a quality I had never been exposed to.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Contemporary paper-cut artists put a new spin on the Chinese folk art</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The change in me wasn’t immediate. I was a student in the painting department, and I was obsessed with painting. I only started to think about it when I was a graduate student at the Rhode Island School of Design, and was studying sculpture.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The way she used materials was very eccentric and also really experimental; it challenges our perception.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She worked with materials like latex, resin and fibreglass. I remember reading an interview with her, and she said that when she worked with a fibreglass fabricator, she found it was too cold and impersonal, so instead of making these perfect fibreglass products, she embraced mistakes and imperfections, like bubbles in the fibreglass that create a translucent effect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/24/39795648-4762-46d3-b200-0f91d0cd4e2f_daffdd29.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/24/68bd3266-4732-4c9a-87ac-13d5f98e56f5_496225d1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I was experimenting with all kinds of materials and finding my own language. During that process, I saw her journey and thought about her a lot. Some pieces I thought were ugly at the time, but I embraced that. Then as now, my goal was not to create perfect objects to contemplate; I’m more interested in the process, the journey of discovery for myself and the audience.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She was super remarkable during her time, the 1960s, which was dominated by males and minimalism. She’s like an outcast. You can’t quite pin her down – she developed her own language that fully belonged to herself. Her work is mysterious, not easy to identify. That is really inspiring; that as an artist, this is something you can do. It gave me courage: you can be like that, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOmqmtq12iwrS1wmiYq6yZmLmme5JqbW1saW18qbvWZqygpKliwKTBy6mrrqqVYrK3rYyhnKyrlWKwqa3NoJydZZGnwW6%2F066bnqak</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
