I was hitting the pain pills hard because I’d had to endure twenty-five procedures, including ten to my back, facial operations from being kicked, knee and hip replacements, and abdominal and shoulder surgeries,” the <a href=#>celebrity</a> wrestler explained.</p><p>He then told that publication that around five or six years ago he was in “crazy pain” to the extent he couldn’t even function.</p><p>“I needed pain meds at that stage, that’s for sure. But once things started to wind down, they continued giving me the same meds. It got to a point where I’d recovered from the tenth back surgery, and the pharmacy would call me and say, ‘Your prescription’s ready,’ and like a dog chasing a bone, I’d go pick it up,” he revealed.</p><p>There then came a point where the wrestler decided he didn’t need them. Although his body hurt from all the injuries caused by wrestling, he said he was not in excruciating pain that he can’t live with.</p><p>The powerhouse then started using CBD, which was introduced to him by Ric Flair, Mike Tyson, and Chad Bronstein, as he claimed he noticed “immediate change” as soon as he started on it, and is now launching his own wellness brand.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-wwe-superstar-on-why-he-quit-drinking-alcohol>The WWE superstar on why he quit drinking alcohol</h2><p>As Hogan got candid with the publication about his <a href=#>health</a> journey, he also opened up about his decision to quit drinking alcohol seven months ago.</p><p>Speaking on his decision to quit with Muscle and Health, the 70-year-old, who would have been 69 at the time of the decision, revealed: &nbsp;</p><p>“About seven months ago, I decided not to drink any more alcohol. I was at a New Year’s Eve party and saw a bunch of stuff that I didn’t condone or like. I saw myself in this environment, and I went, ‘You know what? I don’t know how I got here, but I’m done.’</p><p>The star shared that he feels so much better being clear-headed, and has no temptation to start drinking again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hogan-prepares-for-a-new-adventure>Hogan prepares for a ‘new adventure’</h2><p>After turning the big 7-0 earlier this month, Hulk took to his <a href=#>Instagram</a> to thank fans, friends, and family for the love, as he embarks on a “new adventure.”</p><p>In the caption, he penned: “Reflecting over last week’s birthday as Hulkamania celebrated 70 trips around the sun, and what a ride it’s been! The outpouring of love from fans, friends, and family warms my heart.</p><p>“This chapter is just the start of a new adventure, and I’m ready to keep being the best, the strongest, and the most positive Hulkster I can be!”</p><p>From giving up alcohol to launching his wellness brand, and getting engaged, the legend looks to have a bright future ahead of his already highly successful past.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2d%2FcLTUpaJmoJ%2Bcrq%2B%2FjK%2BgnKGfqsBur9ico55ln6N6sb7ErJqroaCptrC6jKmgpaSjYq6nwMSrZKytlpuys7XNoGScqpGvxm68wKKlaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
