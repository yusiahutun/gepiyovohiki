Speaking to Taste of Country during the Country Cares seminar at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis on Jan. 25, Hayes admitted that he scrapped more than 100 songs and wiped the board clean to begin a process of making music more true to who he is today, not five years ago."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

With only a few minutes to talk about St. Jude and his music, he didn't dive into details, but indicated he's not afraid to go there at some point. Songs like "Heartbreak" and "<a href=#>Dear God</a>" share his anxieties. Both songs describe love lost and the deep melancholy of heartbreak.</p><p class=p1>"Just an attitude of, I don't know if anyone is gonna list to this or if anyone's gonna care, but I need it," the 27-year-old says, summarizing how he was feeling while making new music.</p><p class=p1>"Heartbreak"&nbsp;came out&nbsp;last week. The uptempo, looking-for-life-long-love song stays true to Hayes' pop sensibilities, but reveals more about his personal life. He's long kept many of the details&nbsp;of his love life private, but&nbsp;confirms to&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;his multi-year relationship&nbsp;with Libby Barnes has ended.</p><p class=p1>Changes in his love life and music aren't it for Hayes. He's also sporting a simpler haircut to start 2019. It's pretty much a buzzcut for the "Somebody's Heartbreak" hitmaker, and he sports it with confidence.</p><p class=p1><strong>18 Country Stars You Forgot Dated Celebrities:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoa2eqbKzeceasJ6rXaeyra3Toqanq5ievW6u0Z6YpK2gYrumw4yspqefo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
