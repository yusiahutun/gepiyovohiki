They&nbsp;even made the news of the relationship public among his followers. Through their dating period, the two have been spotted together, spending time together in several places such as Japan.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Interestingly, the pair seem to be very fond of Japan and visited the country twice in 2019. They first visited the country in April and likewise for the second time in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">July</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><img alt height=1102 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/celebrity/Ice-Poseidon's-Girlfriend-Dating-Life-Family-Net-Worth.JPG" width=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Ice Poseidon spends time with girlfriend Kimberly at&nbsp;Shibuya, Tokyo&nbsp;on 12th April 2019 </strong>(Photo:&nbsp;Ice Poseidon's Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Thankfully the love birds haven't shied away from flaunting their relationship on various occasions. Ice was even spotted celebrating Kimberly's&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">birthday </a>together in Luxembourg on 14th September 2019.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>Controversy</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Following his venture into a new relationship, the internet icon got into an online feud with his&nbsp;YouTuber colleague <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Boneclinks</a> aka Burger Planet, concerning his girlfriend. Here's what happened.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>High Ranking YouTuber:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Who Is Morgan Adams' Boyfriend? Dating Life, Brother, Net Worth</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>His friend made&nbsp;some harsh opinions about Kimberly based on his first meeting with her. The Youtuber was shooting a LIVE video on 14th March 2018 during the fateful meeting. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>In the video,&nbsp;Ice's girlfriend Kimberly could be seen waiting for her Tinder date; a wealthy YouTuber named Ryan. In the video, she&nbsp;admitted that she was dating Ryan for financial gains instead of love.</p><p style=text-align:justify>So,&nbsp;in January 2019, his friend claimed that Kimberly was using Ice for financial gain and fame in the name of love. Basically, Ice's friend was accusing Kimberly&nbsp;of being a golddigger since she had already admitted dating her previous bf for financial gain. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>After all, with such history, anyone would assume that her next relationship would be based on the selfish act of monetary gain. Especially in the case of Ice as he is an established YouTuber.</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, the streamer's relationship with his partner wasn't affected by any of these. He even came to Kimberly's defense among viewers by saying,</p><p style=text-align:justify>"She might be the one for me, she's very real and she is not a clout chaser."</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, for now, Ice's relation with Kimberly is going stronger than ever. None of these claims seems to have affected their relationship or else news of their split would have made to the tabloids. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Net Worth</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Ice's financial position is quite&nbsp;impressive as his net worth stands at&nbsp;$250,000, which is growing with time.
