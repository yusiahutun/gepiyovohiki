We all know we have to wear sunscreen every day but for many of us, that’s easier said then done. When you have sensitive and/or acne-prone skin, finding an option you actually want to wear is half the battle."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

When you have sensitive and/or acne-prone skin, finding an option you actually want to wear is half the battle. <a href=# id=auto-tag_innbeauty-project data-tag=innbeauty-project>InnBeauty Project</a> set out to change that with its brand-new <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.sephora.com/product/innbeauty-project-mineral-sun-glow-broad-spectrum-spf-43-pa-with-peptides-vitamin-c-P510941?>Mineral Sun Glow Broad Spectrum SPF 43 PA +++</a>. It’s a sunscreen that does it all—and without a white cast.</p><p>Founders Alisa Metzger and Jen Shane love <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1020497>mineral sunscreen</a> but were frustrated with the current options on the market. (Same, TBH.) They don’t believe there are any single-shade versions that don’t leave some kind of white cast on darker skin tones. The solution is often to go with chemical sunscreens, which while safe, can be irritating for those with sensitive skin. Add in the glowy finish we all want (and is so popular!) and it becomes a nightmare for people who deal with <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1629599 rel="noreferrer noopener">breakouts</a>. Can’t we have it all?!</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>It seems we can.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mineral-sun-glow-01.jpg><p>Mineral Sun Glow Broad Spectrum SPF 43 PA +++ is a mineral sunscreen great for sensitive and acne-prone skin with 14.28 percent non-nano zinc oxide for broad spectrum UVA and UVB protection. Not only does it provide thorough protection, but it also leaves zero white cast. It’s lightly tinted (seriously, so light there’s virtually no coverage) in two shades, Fair-Medium and Medium-Deep, to ensure that ashy, ghostly look doesn’t exist on any skin tone.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>But the founders didn’t stop there. They also added skincare-like ingredients including <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=634762>vitamin C</a> and rice extract for antioxidant protection, skin brightening, and protection from blue light damage. There are also skin-plumping peptides and natural moisturizing factors that keep skin hydrated. You get that glowy finish that’s still natural-looking and, best of all, is free from fragrance and pore-clogging ingredients. And if you’re prone to redness and breakouts like I am, there’s also the addition of acnilys to balance the skin’s oil production and reduce redness.</p><p>I was so impressed with the lit-from-within glow the sunscreen gave me that I took this silly little Uber selfie. I wore it alone with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1260415>concealer</a> to get a better idea of the finish, but I can see how well it would work under foundation. The lightweight, gel-cream texture makes for a great primer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/elizabeth-denton-sunscreen.png><p>I’m (obviously) wearing the shade Fair-Medium but I also tried Medium-Deep and it gave me a pretty bronze glow. Again, these really don’t have coverage. It’s just to neutralize the zinc color—because we all should have the option of wearing mineral sunscreen without looking like we’re wearing sunscreen.</p><p>It seems I’m not the only fan of this newbie. “Where was this my whole life?” asked TikToker Aisha Nur. “It speaks for itself. This is perfect, literally perfect.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>Rachel Finley (@HydrationCEO) agrees. “So glowy, so hydrating, but it doesn’t feel like a typical mineral sunscreen, like, it’s not heavy, thick or cakey,” she says. “Doesn’t irritate my eyes, doesn’t break me out. This is a winner.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><br></figure><p>This formula is so smart, it will force all suncare companies to level up.
