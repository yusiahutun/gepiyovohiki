According to streaming service Line TV, 2Gether surpassed 100 million views on the platform by April 2020, becoming one of its most popular shows that year. Thailand has become one of the biggest producers of these shows – Bangkok Post reports that over 30 BL shows were produced in the country last year alone.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">The evolution of Willow Smith: meet Will and Jada’s daughter</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A usual BL series will consist of 30-minute-long episodes that follow the story of two boys in a high school or university setting, much like 2Gether, or South Korea’s Semantic Error. BLs from China or Taiwan have expanded the genre further into fantasy and drama with shows like The Untamed, or workplace dramas like History 3: Trapped.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The BL genre is essentially a modern-day adaptation of the manga genre yaoi, which originated in Japan and initially focused on stories of relationships between two men. The genre emerged in the 1970s and has since grown to mainstream popularity. While yaoi originally existed as manga, modern day BL genres have expanded to many types of media, including anime, web comics, TV shows, films and video games.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/23/3c08e044-2b27-4de9-b37c-744d94d9fd3c_7bcac3af.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These shows have brought together millions of fans from around the world, regardless of age, race or gender identity. On Twitter, hashtags trend weekly as new episodes of shows are released, and subreddits (forum boards on popular online community website Reddit) are overflowing with comments about fan-favourite moments. Some even have entire YouTube channels dedicated to BLs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of these fans is 29-year-old Jordan S. from California. “I initially found out about BL through manga,” he said, though now he mainly watches Thai BL shows.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">While yaoi originally existed as manga, modern day BL genres have expanded to many types of media</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He was always fond of the genre, but wasn’t aware of just how large the fandom was until he fully immersed himself. In 2019, he began making BL reaction videos for YouTube. He said he was initially drawn to BL shows because the gay characters don’t have to overcome obstacles in order to live their authentic lives. They are the love stories he hoped to see on-screen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As a gay man, through [these shows], I’ve found people that I can talk to that I can actually relate to,” Jordan S. said. “I’ve made a group of friends online who I can open up to and be comfortable around.” He’s even been able to meet up with some members of his online community in person.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/23/b455d024-b58e-4e4f-bdc7-6f68f74d44d9_5b21820d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For many fans, BL shows have created safe spaces across social media.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Did Reese Witherspoon’s daughter Ava Phillippe come out as LGBT?</span></p></a></h3>“I’ve always been a fandom person, from Teen Wolf to K-pop, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">all the way back to the Jonas Brothers</span></a> and Justin Bieber,” 27-year-old Alexa J. said. “As I got older and came into my identity as a bisexual, discovering a genre that exists in a world where no one bats an eyelash at everyone being gay really stuck out to me,” she said. Through other online spaces, she found a Discord server for fans of BL – an online chat room for fans to gather. This is where she met 32-year-old Pixie O., who was active in some of the same channels.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/23/7e1c9990-e7be-406f-a4ef-613d68484d08_41377ced.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As they became closer friends, Pixie pitched the idea to Alexa that they should host a podcast, which led to the inception of Lovecast: A BL Podcast. Despite living in different countries, the two said they maintained a friendship through the BL fandom and created a community where people can engage with each other and have meaningful discussions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unlike Alexa, who identifies as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, Pixie identifies as straight and is aware of the common conception that, through BL, straight women may be taking up queer spaces.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This space is also for me,” she said. “It’s a place where I feel safe. It’s a place where I can learn about myself and learn about the world without the male gaze.” Historically, women created yaoi as a form of entertainment free of misogyny and traditional gender roles. “That’s what drew me to the genre at first,” Pixie explained, “but what made me stay is the stories and the community.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/23/ff1bb804-c8ce-403e-acf2-3fe2839e5fab_2eb16b45.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their small community has since grown, and their podcast has added a third host: 26-year-old Kayla who had her own YouTube channel to discuss BL shows. Kayla used her platform to discuss social issues within various BL dramas, such as colourism, homophobia within the industry, bullying and the romanticisation of abuse. “I wanted to discuss these issues from my perspective as a lesbian and a Filipino-American,” she explained to Insider. She was a guest on the podcast for two episodes before joining as a host.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">‘I was a binge-eater’ – inside LGBT icon Jazz Jennings’ weight journey</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a recent episode of their podcast, Kayla and Alexa addressed some of these issues directly, starting a conversation about colourism within BL shows. “It’s hard for me to comment on these issues directly because I’m not Asian,” Alexa shared, “but as a light-skinned black person, it often is hard watching a drama and seeing characters with a lighter complexion [than me] being subjected to various stereotypes”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kayla echoes the notion that it’s sometimes difficult to consume media that perpetuates these colourist ideals where fair skin is represented as superior. The trio now use their platform to discuss their favourite parts of these shows, while also sparking important conversations around issues that impact their communities. They said the podcast helps them learn and grow from each others’ lived experiences.</p>This article originally appeared on <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Insider</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpydnJqvs7XTsmaaqqSesK2xjmxocWpnaoFwtc2soJ2dXZbAqq3SZqabq5WowKq7zWaZqLGjYrmwwsRmq69lo528uL%2BMqqyenaJiwKa%2ByJ6q</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
