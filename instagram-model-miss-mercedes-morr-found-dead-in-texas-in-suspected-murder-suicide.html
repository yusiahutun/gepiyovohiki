The father of Mercedes Morr -- real name Janae Gagnier -- described the moment he found his daughter's body, initially believing she fell down the stairs. Mark Gagnier said he only realized she had been murdered when his girlfriend ran upstairs and found the suspect, Kevin Alexander Accorto, still &#34;twitching&#34; and &#34;gurgling.&#34;
Recounting the horrific Sunday in a 30-minute-plus interview with ABC13, he said he went round to his daughter's house — only a few minutes away from his own — to check in on her, after family and friends reported not being able to get hold of her."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I wouldn't have kicked the door in if I didn't know something was wrong, and what I saw did not surprise me at that moment, because I knew something was wrong," he said.</p><p>He described the scene as "just disgusting inside": He found his daughter motionless, in a state of undress, at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>"My daughter was on the ground, and at that moment, I thought Janae had an accident and fell down the stairs... she looked like she came home, was getting undressed and fell down the stairs," he said.</p><p>"So I was like, 'Baby run upstairs and get something to cover Janae up'... and I kind of like turned away. When she ran upstairs and saw the guy - then I realized it wasn't an accident."</p><p>"So as soon as she went upstairs and saw the guy, that's when my anger level got so bad, that all I could feel was just hot anger, and all I could do was just sit there and watch him until the police got there."</p><p>"He was twitching, he was gurgling. I could look in the room, there's writing all over the walls," he said, adding the suspect had been in there for two days.</p><p>"There's blood all over the apartment," he continued, adding that it was supposedly when he kicked the door in that the suspect attempted to take his own life.</p><p>"When the detective told me that she had been strangled, that's all I can think about in my mind," he went on. "I did not want my daughter to go out in any kind of pain or suffering or any kind of traumatic anything... and I would have been happy with the thought in my mind that he pushed her, or she fell down the stairs, because it's quick. And I know that's a bad thought, but I didn't want my daughter to be in any kind of struggle, fight or pain."</p><p>"I'm almost okay in my mind about something that happens by an accident... or something that happens, like sickness and stuff? That in my mind is not okay, but it happens, it's life. I am not okay with murder, okay?"</p><p>Speaking alongside Jenae's mother Jeaneta, he said that while they knew who is suspected of killing her, they didn't know why, or how he managed to gain access to the house.</p><p>"I don't know how the guy got into the place, because it was locked up tightly, and my daughter does not open the door for anybody," her dad insisted.</p><p>He revealed the alleged killer had not parked right in front of Janae's house, but ten houses down; he said his daughter sometimes left the garage door open, and that he must have slipped in that way. He also said it must have happened some time after 11 AM Saturday morning, because Janae had texted a friend then, right before everyone lost contact with her.</p><p>Both parents said they were tortured by the thoughts of what they had been doing at the exact moment their daughter was being killed.</p><p>Her dad also admitted the sheer number of her social media followers "scared the hell out of me".</p><p>"Janae had a lot of followers, and I warned Janae about her followers," he said. "Some were true followers, some were there for their own reason; apparently one was a little nutty."</p><p>Some of her real friends, he admitted, even thought her real name was Mercedes Morr.</p><p>"Janae was a handful to her dad... and I loved that about her. She kept me on my toes, I swear," he added.</p><p>The parents say they intend setting up a GoFundMe to celebrate their late daughter's life.</p><p class="divider-block__text divider-block__stroke-color-secondary">original story 8/31/2021 8:41 AM</p><p>Instagram model Miss Mercedes Morr has been found dead in what police believe was a murder suicide.</p><p>The 33-year-old, whose real name was Janae Gagnier, was discovered in her Texas apartment on Sunday during a welfare check.
