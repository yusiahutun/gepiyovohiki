Most recently, the <a href=#>Whose Line Is It Anyway</a> alum was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">engaged to Amie Harwick</a>, a licensed marriage and family therapist. Drew popped the question to her in January 2018, but the pair called it off less than a year later. According to Drew’s rep, the split was “very amicable.”</p><p>In February 2020, Amie died after falling off a balcony in her Hollywood Hills home following an alleged dispute with her ex-boyfriend, <strong>Gareth Pursehouse</strong>. The Los Angeles Police Department said she had “significant injuries consistent with a fall” in a press release. An autopsy at the time determined she had been strangled first. Pursehouse was arrested shortly after Harwick’s death and posted the $2 million bond. In April, he pled not guilty to her murder.</p><p>“I hope you’re lucky enough to have someone in your life that loves as much as she did,” Carey <a href=#>wrote via Twitter</a> following news of her death. He was so distraught over his ex-fiancée’s passing that he put <a href=# rel>The Price Is Right</a>&nbsp;on hold and had to <a href=#>cancel production</a> the week her death was announced.</p><p>“Amie and I had a love that people are lucky to have once in a lifetime,” he said in a statement to Closer. “She was a positive force in the world, a tireless and unapologetic champion for women and passionate about her work as a therapist. I am overcome with grief. I would like to thank you in advance for giving myself and everyone who loved Amie privacy while we try to work through this tragic situation.”</p><p><span>In February 2022, CBS announced it would air </span><i><span>48 Hours: The Final Hours of Amie Harwick</span></i><span>. Drew shared the final text message he received from his ex-fiancée before her death In an emotional clip released ahead of the episode.</span></p><p><span>“I got a text from her [that read], ‘I would love to get together with you and talk,'” the television personality recalled. “And I said, ‘Yeah, I would love to do that. I love you.’”</span></p><p><span>Drew was visibly emotional during the interview, sharing that the pair never had the chance to meet up. He was left devastated by the news of her passing.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“That’s the big solace I get from it, is that she loved me … And I’m glad I could get that message to her before she died,” he said.</span></p><h2><strong>Who Is Drew Carey’s Ex-Fianceé Nicole Jaracz?</strong></h2><p>Before Amie, the comedian was ready to marry girlfriend <strong>Nicole Jaracz</strong>, who he proposed to in 2007. Sadly, the couple went their separate ways just five years later. At the time of their split, his rep told Us Weekly, “He and Nicole still have a great deal of love and affection for one another. He will still be very involved with their son’s life.”</p><p>The couple never did have any kids together during their relationship, but Drew is a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">father figure to Nicole’s son Connor</a>. To this day, the trio has remained quite close. On <a href=#>Mother’s Day</a> 2016, the former Marine <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took to Instagram</a> to send his ex a special message.</p><p>“And lifelong thanks and love and gratitude to Nicole for bringing this guy into my life,” he sweetly gushed in the caption alongside a photo of the young boy resting on his chest. “Happy Mother’s Day to you especially.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Is-Drew-Carey-Married-Relationship-History-TV-Host-Exes.jpg><p>At the moment, it seems like Drew is a single man, but perhaps there will be a Mrs. Drew Carey in the near future. For now, the TV star will continue to host the <a href=#>iconic game show</a> — something he has done since 2007.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46iqmacoprEbq%2FAq5yyZZ2Wv7O1xJ1ksKCfYra0edOhnGaoop6wpnnIrGSroZedwW60zqyrrGWnnrOmew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
