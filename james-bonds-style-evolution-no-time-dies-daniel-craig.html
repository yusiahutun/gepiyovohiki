Back in the 1960s, he was depicted as despising The Beatles, for example. In 1995’s Goldeneye, when he met the first female M played by Judi Dench, she called him “a sexist, misogynist dinosaur; a relic of the Cold War, whose boyish charms [are] wasted on me”. A full quarter-century later, countless column inches have been devoted to Bond’s relevance – or arguable lack thereof – in this woke, #MeToo era.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, putting his backward-looking conception of masculinity and the male/female relationship dynamic aside for a moment, one area where 007 has always been firmly in step with the zeitgeist is in terms of style.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/10/04/01e24761-d4f0-4aef-8226-f12c5f57ba1e_17eb4cce.jpg>The Bond of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Ian Fleming’s books</span></a> was a little more of a classicist, but in his translation to the big screen for 1962’s Dr. No, director Terence Young chose not to have Sean Connery outfitted on London’s then hyper-traditional Savile Row. Instead, he took the burly Scottish former bodybuilder around the corner, to Anthony Sinclair on Conduit Street – Young’s own tailor.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Melania Trump’s best on-screen appearances in film, TV and ads</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was the start of an ongoing sartorial relationship that would see Connery’s Bond dressed in some of the sharpest, hourglass-waisted, slim-lapelled tailoring seen in the ‘60s. The ivory, peak-lapel dinner jacket and the grey glen plaid three-piece suit Connery wore in 1964’s Goldfinger (1964) are considered particularly iconic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/10/04/aae45c00-480a-4f39-ae16-aa6f9b453f9a_a8bb87c7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By the time of 1971’s Diamonds Are Forever, Connery’s sixth appearance as the character, Bond’s style had evolved for a new era. His lapels, collars, cuffs and ties had grown fatter, his hair (or perhaps more accurately, hairpiece) had grown longer. The stage was set for a new, funkier Bond. Enter: Roger Moore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/10/04/538a4188-054a-426a-9381-58076e2afebd_ca7bfb54.jpg>Moore’s style as Bond was so of-the-moment that it quickly looked out of date – 1970s fashion had become a laughingstock by the 1980s. But with hindsight, we now look back on Moore’s chunky lapels, flared trousers and occasional flamboyant patterns <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">with renewed appreciation.</span></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/10/04/fe7c8b74-962b-455a-8d08-4c76b0387f93_242c874c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The attire that Moore wore was mostly made by tailors the actor personally favoured. These included Cyril Castle (responsible for the iconic safari jacket worn in The Man With the Golden Gun, 1974), Angelo Roma (who cut the fantastic double-breasted, midnight blue tuxedo seen in The Spy Who Loved Me, 1977) and Douglas Hayward, who made most of Moore’s classic suits and blazers.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Jennifer Aniston vs Reese Witherspoon: who has the most lavish lifestyle?</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/10/04/66d14217-426e-4fd7-a137-a06eebcb3794_60bc40b1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Timothy Dalton took over as Bond in the 1980s, he adopted the sober, designer business suits that were de rigueur in the corporate world at the time. Similarly, Pierce Brosnan, who began playing Bond in 1995, was outfitted by costume designer Lindy Hemming in a wardrobe from Brioni.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since its foundation in the post-war period, this legendary Roman tailoring house has dressed an array of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful men, with a client list including countless royals, presidents, leading industrialists and billionaires. It made sense for Bond to wear the brand, allowing him to fit in effortlessly in the most rarefied of social circles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/10/04/9199b220-3c95-4b27-8871-066f498d32bd_0de544f7.jpg>Brosnan’s successor, Daniel Craig, has occasionally worn Brioni and other top Italian luxury houses such as Massimo Alba and Brunello Cucinelli, as well as clothing from Britain’s Sunspel and N.Peal. But the label that has become synonymous with Craig’s tenure as 007 reads, in all caps, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Tom Ford</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The silhouettes Ford shaped for Bond are slimmer in the lapel than his signature generous, disco-influenced styling, with more of a streamlined 1960s feel. The cut is utterly contemporary, however, designed to showcase a modern gym-honed physique. (Craig’s Bond may have no time to die, but he clearly does have time to diet – and exercise.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/10/04/7936b82b-53d6-4b30-b12e-f33b0d5c4145_4a14d943.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Without question, many of Bond’s ways remain mired in the toxically masculine, sexist mists of time. Yet clad in Tom Ford tailoring, his look is as cutting edge as any hi-tech gadget Q branch could ever dream up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpydnJqvs7XTsmaaqqSesK2xjmxobmlgboBwtsCmnKxlkqS7pb%2BMrKuypJVisre7y66roqeeYruwedOipJ5llJ6ytHnDmqWinZxisLOtyKA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
