After admitting that she is a “nepo baby,” the Knives Out actress noted that she “married an actor.”</p><p>“I love actors. I love acting. I love the job we get to do,” she said. “I love being a part of a crew. I love being a part of a cast.”</p><p>Jamie Lee continued the speech by gushing about her career. “I love what we do with each other,” she told the audience. “It’s such a beautiful job and I know that so many people in our industry who are actors don’t get to do this job and you look at nights like this and think, ‘Is that ever gonna be possible for me?’”</p><p>In addition to Jamie Lee’s nomination, the film is up for 10 awards at the Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.</p><p>The pair tied the knot in December 1984.

That’s really it – two words … because you will want to,” she said. “If you’re telling me anybody who’s married for a long time hasn’t thought ‘I hate them, I want out,’ of course they have! I believe if you stay on the bus long enough, the scenery will change!”</p><p><strong>Keep scrolling to see photos of Jamie and Christopher’s date night at the Oscars.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jmKahlWK5prGMnKyrrJmoeqnB0puYp5xdmLWztdKtpqmglad6rq3KnmSrmaKaerC%2FwpqprGWfqsGqusZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
