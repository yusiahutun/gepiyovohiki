Here’s everything we know about Jennifer Lynn Stone.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/photo_2023-06-14_08-54-11-fotor-202306149234-731x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Fred_Savages_Wife></span>Who Is Fred Savage’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jennifer Lynn Stone was born in 1973 in Glencoe, Chicago, USA. Like many celebrity spouses, there is little information about Stone’s childhood. Along with her exact birthdate, she hasn’t revealed the identity of her parents. The identity of her siblings also remains a mystery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, there is no information about her elementary and high school education. Although she hasn’t revealed the school and course of study, Jennifer Lynn Stone is a University graduate. Several reports hint that the actor’s wife studied business marketing. However, these reports are unconfirmed.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jennifer_Lynn_Stones_Career></span>Jennifer Lynn Stone’s Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After graduating college, Fred Savage’s wife decided to earn a living through real estate. She became a registered agent and made a decent living by working as a real estate agent. However, it is unknown how far up the ladder she climbed in real estate, as the celebrity spouse has not shared much about her pre-marital life.&nbsp;</p><p>After her marriage to the actor, some reports claim that she quit her job to focus on her family. Others claim Jennifer Lynn Stone has ventured into filmmaking herself. However, these reports are unconfirmed as “The Wonder Years” actor’s wife has not disclosed any information regarding her career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Jennifer_Lynn_Stone_Meet_Her_Husband></span>How Did Jennifer Lynn Stone Meet Her Husband?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The couple have known each other since childhood, growing up in the same neighborhood. Their parents were next-door neighbors, and the actor who later became her husband was the boy next door. Unfortunately, they took separate paths when Savage’s family moved from Chicago to Los Angeles.</p><p>Savage, at the time, was an aspiring actor and had just landed a major role in a TV series. However, his role in “The Wonder Years” series was his breakout role. While he went on to become one of the most notable child actors at the time, Stone went on to focus on her education.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/photo_2023-06-14_08-54-03-fotor-2023061485920.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Fred_Savage_Marry_Jennifer_Lynn_Stone></span>When Did Fred Savage Marry Jennifer Lynn Stone?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A decade after they parted ways, Jennifer Lynn Stone reconnected with the actor on his 22nd birthday. The connection between the pair was instantaneous, and their love affair started. Their chemistry was undeniable, it blossomed rapidly, and they started dating. The couple dated for about five years, from 1998-2003.</p><p>Their relationship took a good turn when they went on a romantic getaway to Italy. Where the actor proposed to his childhood friend-turned-lover in September 2003. The proposal was dreamy, and it had the media talking for a while. The actor proposed to her with a 5-carat cushion cut Neil Lane Diamond ring with an inscription that reads, “I must have done something good.”&nbsp;</p><p>The inscription might not mean more than a romantic line on the first read. However, it becomes even more romantic when you find out it’s a line from Stone’s favorite childhood movie, “The Sound of Music.” The couple said their vows the following year on August 7, 2004, in a dreamy <a href=#>wedding</a> ceremony at the L’Orangerie restaurant in Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/photo_2023-06-14_08-52-27-fotor-20230614911.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jennifer_Lynn_Stones_Children></span>Jennifer Lynn Stone’s Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Since tying the knot with the celebrity actor in 2004, Stone and Savage have welcomed three kids. They had their first child, Oliver Savage, in an unnamed Los Angeles Hospital in August 2006. Since his birth, the couple have shielded him from the media. As a result, it is unclear what the celebrity kid has been up to.&nbsp;</p><p>Their second child, and only daughter, Lily Savage, was born on May 3, 2008. Like her brother, there is little information about her. The public has no idea whatsoever about what she has been up to. However, reports claim that she loves sports.&nbsp;</p><p>Last is their youngest child and second son, Auggie Savage. Auggie was born to the power couple on November 26, 2012. Like his older siblings, Auggie was also born in Los Angeles, and little is known about him.&nbsp;</p><p>While it is unclear what she does for a living presently, Jennifer Lynn Stone lives a life of luxury. Her famous husband has a net worth of over $30,000,000.
