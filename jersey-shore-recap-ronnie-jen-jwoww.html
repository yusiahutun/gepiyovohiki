UPDATED AT 6:34 AM ON 10/04/19:
Hours after TMZ reported Ronnie and Jen were hand-in-hand in Beverly Hills, Ron was tased and arrested for kidnapping after an alleged domestic violence dispute with Jen.
According to TMZ, this is what happened:
Around 2:30 a.m. Friday, the couple got into a heated argument at the Airbnb they were renting in Los Angeles."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Ronnie allegedly slapped and punched Jen, before she went running out of the house, screaming for help. Ron then chased after her with a knife in one hand and their 18-month-old daughter, Ariana, in the other. He eventually dropped the knife and locked himself inside the house with the baby. When police arrived on the scene, he refused to come out, so they broke down the door. Ron then refused to be taken into custody peacefully, so police officers had to tase him. After being taken to the hospital, Ron was booked for kidnapping. Neither Jen nor Ariana suffered major physical injuries, though Jen did have visible marks on her face. She told the cops Ronnie went off the rails after doing cocaine.</p><p>He attended rehab earlier this year, and his sobriety has been a major talking point of "Jersey Shore: Family Vacation" Season 3.</p><p><strong>EPISODE RECAP PUBLISHED AT 6:00 PM ON 10/03/19:</strong></p><p>It took <strong><a href=#>Jenni "JWoww" Farley</a></strong> inviting <strong><a href=#>Jen Harley</a></strong> to a strip club behind <strong><a href=#>Ronnie Ortiz-Magro's</a></strong> back to get him to kick his baby mama out of his house and be done with her for good.</p><p>Or so he claims, as <strong><a href=#>TMZ</a></strong> reported today that the two are very much back together.</p><p>Thursday's episode of <strong><a href=#>"Jersey Shore: Family Vacation"</a></strong> picked up with the group leaving <strong><a href=#>Vinny Guadagnino's</a></strong> steamy Chippendales performance and heading to a female strip club to keep the party going. As we know from <strong><a href=#>last week</a></strong>, Jenni drunkenly invited Jen to meet up with them, knowing Ronnie wouldn't be partaking in the festivities. Jen claimed she was worried about Ronnie's sobriety because she hadn't spoken to him in a week, but Ron kept telling his roommates everything was fine.</p><p>"It's been a long day. Came out to support my boy, Vinny, but I'm gonna go home and get some rest. My strip club days are behind me," Ron said during a confessional. "That's not the place for me right now while I'm going through my sobriety, and I don't wanna risk any of that for a night out at a strip club."</p><p>"I'm not gonna go out with the roomies tonight because I don't really think I need anymore f--king drama in my life," he continued. "The issues that I was going through last year f--ked me up. I didn't know how to handle them, so I would just get f--ked up and wasted. That was my outlet. I'm in a way better headspace now. My job is to wake up every day and make myself feel good and do what I have to do for myself."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6d796fbe-62f3-5628-ad6c-a8f4a1d5ec53 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ab40d964-4c05-5585-ae73-0b84dd081872 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/45/5by4/2019/10/02/45e7387bf5b15234af107dacc16d3b44_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">JWoww Shares Update on Son Greyson 1 Year After Autism Diagnosis</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>He had no idea Jenni had been talking to Jen. He also had no idea that Jen was en route to meet up with his roommates, most of whom were mortified by what JWoww was doing.</p><p>"I don't understand why Jenni's getting involved. Like, what the f--k, girl? You're a hypocrite," <strong><a href=#>Angelina Pivarnick</a></strong> said to the camera. "Remember you wanted to kill me because I was talking about your divorce? Now look what you're doing. I think Jenni just wanted to get back at Ronnie because she thinks that Ronnie still talks to <strong><a href=#>Roger [Mathews]</a></strong>. I don't know. I don't really think two wrongs make a right."</p><p>After Jen (who arrived in a zebra mask) gave Jenni a lap dance, she leaned in to give her the 4-1-1. "He's been great, and then all of a sudden, he goes on this trip, and then he's like, 'F--k you, you f--king whore,' blah blah blah," she claimed, noting she hadn't seen Ron since Cabo and that it wasn't her he had been texting incessantly. "Why the 180, you know what I mean? Like, completely not him. Not the person that I've been staying with every f--king night."</p><p>Jenni was shocked to hear it, telling the camera she wished she would've heard it from Ron. "That's what family's for -- we help each other. We can't help you if you don't tell us the problem," she said, quoting almost exactly what Ron said when he got reamed for talking about Jenni's divorce.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Deena Cortese</a></strong> was wasted and intrigued by what Jen was saying, even though she didn't necessarily cosign the plan. Vinny wasn't into it at all, and <strong><a href=#>Pauly D</a></strong> was absolutely furious.</p><p>"So for me, where I come from, no one's gonna change who I am. If my friend's baby mama shows up somewhere and he doesn't know, I'm gonna let him know. He's my friend before she's mine, you know what I'm saying? It's like bro code," Pauly told the camera. In the moment, he decided to text Ron and let him know that Jen was at the strip club, but it didn't appear that he gave him all the info. Vinny felt Pauly "did the right thing."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f7f8543a-3e1c-5dce-a913-7f6a6284145c data-container-ref=toofab:article:ab40d964-4c05-5585-ae73-0b84dd081872 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6c/5by4/2019/09/26/6c3aa6a7fea4564d80f26aa21919a6af_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MTV/Getty/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Jersey Shore' Recap: JWoww Inserts Herself Into Ron-Jen Drama Before Vinny's Chippendales Debut</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Ron was back at the hotel, doing a confessional interview, when his phone went off. He pulled it out of his pocket, read the text and put it back in his pocket. "You good, man?" an off-camera producer asked. Ron said he was, but his face told a different story. After sitting in silence for what MTV made feel like forever, Ronnie eventually got up and said, "Bro, I gotta, I gotta go. Pauly just texted me, bro. She's at f--king Crazy Horse, dude. It's gonna turn into, like, I can't. I've done a lot of work lately on myself and I know my limits. I can't, I can't, I can't relapse because of her, bro. It can't happen, bro." The producer was more than understanding.</p><p>Jen asked Jenni if she was scared Ronnie would show up and be upset with her, but Jenni maintained, "None of this I think in my eyes is negative at all ... I wanted to get to know you, but I also wanna figure out why he's being the way that he is."</p><p>"I almost felt weird coming here because I feel like none of you guys like me," Jen said, which both Jenni and Deena said wasn't true. They told Jen that Ron had been telling them he and Jen were "perfect," which is why Jenni felt comfortable inviting Jen out. Deena told Jen that Ron always made it seem like she was the problem, "but now I know it isn't you," a drunk Deena rambled. "Honestly, I think he's f--ked up for whatever the f--k he's doing! He needs to get his f--king shit together!" she added. Jenni agreed. Angelina was visibly uncomfortable.</p><p>Pauly had to leave to catch a flight (saved by the DJ gig), which is when Ronnie started blowing up Jen's phone. According to Deena, the text messages started with "I f--king hate you" and "You're dead to me" and got nastier from there. Once back at the hotel, the group (sans-Jen) discovered Ron had left. The girls kept asking who told Ron that Jen was at the strip club, but Vinny didn't give it up. They were all worried Ron was out on a Ronpage, and Jenni started to feel bad.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:44732833-3f48-568e-ae21-dbf2e9247771 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ab40d964-4c05-5585-ae73-0b84dd081872 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/54/5by4/2019/09/26/5486b17557415cccabeca64599e237cf_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MTV/Getty/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Drunk JWoww Messages Jen Behind Ronnie's Back: 'I Don't Like Being Bullshit, I Don't Like Being Lied To'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The next day, everyone woke up "hungover as f--k," and Jenni accused Angelina of telling Ronnie about the Jen sitch. She swore up and down it wasn't her. Suddenly, Ron walked in, fresh as a daisy. He simply said he wanted to sleep in his own bed for the night and assured his roommates he was fine. They were all on pins and needles.</p><p>"Everybody's sitting around f--king awkward as f--k, and I'm like, 'Alright, I already know what these guys wanna talk about,'" he told the camera. To their faces, he urged his friends to "say what you gotta say," then revealed that Pauly had texted him the night before to let him know about Jen.</p><p>"She was making it like she was worried for you, like you were off your sobriety," Denna said, but Ronnie calmly explained he was fine and still sober. He told the gang he was furious Jen would try to take him back to a place -- physically and emotionally -- that wasn't good for him and said he ended up kicking her out of their house as a result. "I can't blame anybody but myself because I keep putting myself back in the same situation. I'm expecting more from the person that's never shown me more," he said. Jenni was silent.</p><p>"Now I feel bad we brought her into that thing yesterday," Deena blurted out, which made us audibly gasp, but Ronnie didn't seem to get it. "Everything happens for a reason," he said. "She did it to herself. You didn't do anything."</p><p>That's when Jenni told Ron about the messages between Jen and Angelina, seemingly trying to shift the blame, but Angelina wasn't having it. She told her side of the story, then looked at Jenni and said, "And then she actually came to the club last night willingly because you had -- did you ask her?"</p><p>Jenni knew she was toast. "What? You invited her?" Ron asked. "Why would you invite her, Jenni?" She said it was because Ron and Jen weren't talking. "So you invite her?" he pressed. "She's the last person I want involved in this! I'm not inviting Roger out, dude. Why would you do that?! Jenni, if I'm not gonna be there, you have no right to invite her out to a strip club when she should be home with your f--king niece," he added, referring to his own daughter, Ariana.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f2fb4018-5397-52b1-b333-22ffad9eb072 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ab40d964-4c05-5585-ae73-0b84dd081872 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/43/5by4/2019/09/25/432295c83be55703a7f16246764c1486_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">The Situation's Struggle to Maintain Post-Prison Physique Will Be Featured on 'Jersey Shore' (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"That's not my problem," Jenni said. Ronnie was pissed but handling himself quite well. "You're engaging, you're antagonizing, saying, 'Come here, come here,'" he said. "And she's gonna do it 'cause she's f--king stupid. Why the f--k would you do that?" In his confessional, he vented, "That just shows that you don't have good intentions. You know -- Jenni, Jen -- both f--king fake. I feel super disrespected by Jenni. When Jenni didn't wanna talk about her f--king divorce at the dude ranch, I didn't invite Roger to come out with us and f--king party!"</p><p>The girls assured Ronnie that Jen spoke highly of him, but he didn't care. He was pissed she knew he wasn't going to be there and agreed to go anyway. "She'll do anything to try to manipulate the situation and try to make it seem like it's me and say I'm off my sobriety," he said. He also wasn't happy with her claims that he hadn't seen the baby in a week because he's "always there with that kid, more than she is. She tries to push me and she tries to get me to overreact, and I'm not at that place in my life anymore. I handle things way better than I did last year. I have too much stuff going on right now that she can jeopardize. I can't be with someone that's like that."</p><p>"Jen is supposed to be my girlfriend. We're supposed to be doing this as a family. You're supposed to have my back," he vented. "This whole little petty bullshit nonsense is draining, and it's wasted energy."</p><p>Ronnie then announced he was done with Jen for good ... even if we all know now <strong><a href=#>it didn't stick</a></strong>.</p><p>"Jersey Shore: Family Vacation" airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. on MTV.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
