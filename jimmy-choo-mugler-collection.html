Co-founded in the early '90s by the skilled shoemaker for which the house was named and industry expert Tamara Mellon, its pumps have remained a staple in the closet of powerful and well-dressed women for decades. In a move that ups the ante, the shoe brand has teamed up with Mugler creative director, Casey Cadwallader, to bring their loyal legion of fans the collaboration they never knew they always needed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Mugler and Jimmy Choo are about strength—our women are strong, glamorous and in-control," the accessory brand's creative director Sandra Choi explained about their new joint venture. The notion extends to the campaign. "Here, our women are literally the centre of every image: they are the stars. That these images are captured by a female photographer also adds an extra dimension. Harley’s work always celebrates femininity, a view of women by a woman. There’s an inherent strength to that, which is very Mugler, and quintessentially Jimmy Choo.”</p><img alt="mugler jimmy choo aweng ade chuol" title="mugler jimmy choo aweng ade chuol" width=2500 height=3339 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jimmy-choo-mugler-knee-sandal-1644431940.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Harley Weir @ Art Partner</span><p>Aweng Ade-Chuol in the lace-up metallic sandals from the collection.&nbsp;</p><img alt="sora choi mugler jimmy choo" title="sora choi mugler jimmy choo" width=1800 height=2404 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jimmy-choo-mugler-sandal-b-1644432051.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Harley Weir @ Art Partner</span><p>Model Sora Choi starring in the Jimmy Choo and Mugler campaign.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cadwallader added, "A shoe finishes the look and defines character. I have always associated Jimmy Choo with a very strong sense of sculpture in shoes, a balance of sharpness and curve. Both Mugler and Jimmy Choo are forward and sensual, and both worn by strong and confident women. That's why this collaboration makes so much sense. There’s a clear synergy between Sandra and I when we work together.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The shoes in the collection are a prime example of just how well the brands mesh. Combining Jimmy Choo's artful designs with Mugler's heritage details, the lineup features key pieces like sock booties that mirror the luxury house's distinct spiral design. Other styles included are a pair of lace-up metallic sandals as-worn by model Aweng Ade-Chuol in the campaign, as well as neon options for those looking to standout.
