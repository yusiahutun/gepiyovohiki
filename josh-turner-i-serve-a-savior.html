Titled “The River (of Happiness),” the track features them singing together along with the couple's other three sons. "It’s an uplifting song," Turner says in a press release, "and having Jennifer and the boys singing on it drives that home.”</p><p>The project is the realization of a dream Turner has had for years. His deep faith has informed much of his mainstream country output, and he says his fans have been clamoring for a gospel project for years.</p><figure class="img-tag alignright" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>josh-turner-i-serve-a-savior-cover-art</span></p>MCA Nashville<p>loading...</p></figure><p>“Working on this project has definitely been a God-ordained blessing. I never would have thought I’d be doing this record this year, but God opened a door and I walked through it,” Turner states. “I’ve seen many seemingly impossible things take place during the making of this record and I’ve felt God’s anointing over it.”</p><p>The project is accompanied by a 90-minute live performance DVD of the new collection, which Turner filmed at Gaither Studios. The DVD features a special performance by the Turner family, as well as a segment in which gospel legend Bill Gaither interviews Turner. It will also air as an edited one-hour television special that Gaither will host this fall on several networks across the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>I Serve a Savior is set for release on Oct. 26.</p><p><strong>Josh Turner's&nbsp;I Serve a Savior Track Listing:</strong></p><p>1.
