Divorce Attorney Shin: Cho Seung-woo leads Korean legal drama on Netflix
Sung-han and Hyeong-geun enjoy wonderful repartee as they lightly rib each other or delight in the same small pleasures, whether a bowl of instant noodles at a noodle shop run by Kim So-yeun (Kang Mal-geum) or the moment that former radio host Lee Seo-jin (Han Hye-jin) fixes the office’s sliding door when she puts herself forward for a job in their firm that they did not know they were hiring for."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Sung-han begins representing Ma Chun-seok (Choi Jae-sup), a middle-aged man living a hardy existence far down south in the countryside.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chun-seok is married to the much younger Vietnamese woman Dinh Thi Hoa (Kim Huong Ji-yun), who is seeking a divorce and custody of their child, claiming her husband was abusive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/28/f37c2e3e-2664-40ab-b0e0-6bd31d01572c_d706b830.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Compared to the other cases that Sung-han takes on, this one proves to be a bit of a headscratcher. He has been very picky with his cases so far, considering for a long time whether he should take on clients and only doing so when he finds something in their story that he can relate to.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chun-seok appears in his office after having received his card from Jin Yeong-ju (Noh Susanna) from the powerful Keumhwa Law Firm that represents his wife.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yeong-ju is also the stepmother of Sung-han’s beloved nephew Seo Gi-yeong (Kim Joon-eui) and has been trying to cut Sung-han out of her stepson’s life. Sung-han takes the bait, but we do not really understand why.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The case becomes a national issue and, in the face of a public outcry, Sung-han needs a bold strategy. He finds it by inserting himself in the narrative. He reveals his past as a brilliant pianist, sharing a video shot by lawyer Choi Jun (Han Eun-sung) that he spent the earlier episodes of the show trying to take down before Jun switched from Keumhwa to his firm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/28/a822838c-445f-4ad1-a179-81455a5efc13_a21a15c0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All is not as it seems in Chun-seok’s case and it eventually transpires that he himself was a victim.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Divorce Attorney Shin may be fiction but, like other recent legal dramas, it follows a narrative approach that stitches together cases which embellish ripped-from-the-headlines issues. Earlier cases in the series reflect this approach, but Chun-seok’s case goes against the prevailing winds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Thanks to the declining birth rate and the exodus of young people to major cities, men in the Korean countryside have for years faced meagre marriage prospects and women from developing countries, often brought in through arranged marriages, have stepped in to fill this need. But life is often very difficult for them as they adjust to rural Korean surroundings that can be patriarchal and xenophobic.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">7 of the best new Korean drama series to look out for in March 2023</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Keumhwa, as the firm representing the Vietnamese wife, should be on the right of the issue (statistically), but the show engineers it the other way around, with the middle-aged man becoming the sympathetic figure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This gives Sung-han a unique legal challenge, but it is an odd social hill for the show to plant its flag on.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another awkwardly sympathetic middle-aged male is Choi Jeong-ho (Jeon Joong-yong), a cheating husband with liver cancer who will die if he does not marry his mistress, since his wife will not donate her liver to him; his mistress legally cannot.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This may prove just a blip in a series that has otherwise championed marginalised figures, such as Seo-jin, who was terrorised by a possessive husband who tarnished her image with a sex tape, or housewife Park Ae-ran (Hwang Jung-min), who suffers under the thumb of her abusive mother-in-law for 20 years before finally snapping.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/28/938639b4-0960-4965-81ad-a550ed121b92_420106c8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another refreshing aspect of the show is that, while Sung-han is positioned as a brilliant legal mind – an image he plays up himself – in truth he has not been terribly effective as a lawyer so far.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He favours bold tactics but they occasionally backfire on him and some cases, like Ae-ran’s, resolves themselves completely in spite of his role in them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Perhaps in an effort to please a broader viewing public, Divorce Attorney Shin plays to different audiences from case to case, giving the show a social spectrum that is so elastic that it risks both pleasing and annoying viewers – but for different reasons.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet, aside from its seesawing morals, it is often a comforting ride, with an engaging leading turn from Cho and solid assists from the supporting cast, particularly Kim Sung-kyun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/28/e956dd82-ae45-4e3c-8a29-525b9ffc7334_d92278f2.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Divorce Attorney Shin is streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLhuvM6pZqRllKeurq2OmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkWpsaXBlZLhusNGapJplnZ6xtLHArKanZaKasKK8jJ2gr6eimLJurdOtpqumla56tLTIp2SeppeWtKq6xmajnp%2BRoXqlvsCmmGarpJa%2Fs7XNoGScoJ9iwKbBzaBksKefYr2trdisZJunpJ0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
