Musgraves got the honor of performing his tune “Rainbow Stew,” for which her throwback style was a perfect fit.</p><p>The artist is clearly a fan of the song, walking out with excitement to perform it and singing it with a smile. In fact, Musgraves says its message ended up being as fitting for 2017 as it was for 1981 when it was originally released.</p><p>“Whenever I dug it out and kind of dusted it off — I knew the song, but I hadn’t really listened to the lyrics in a while,” she says. “I was like, ‘Oh my God’ — it’s very progressive and very in line with what we’re going on in the world right now. I thought it would be something cool to say and sing.”</p><p>The tune is a tongue-in-cheek declaration of hope for a better future when war is over and the “President does what he says he’ll do.” It was the lead-off single from Haggard’s live album Rainbow Stew Live at Anaheim Stadium and hit No. 4 on the country charts.</p><p><strong>Merle Haggard's Wife Tears Up Talking About Him</strong></p><p><strong>See Photos of Merle Haggard Through the Years</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJmTmsZuudSsnquZpprAbrnEq6OeZZiWtKit0Z1kq5mZo6%2Bww4ysq56vXZi8t7HRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
