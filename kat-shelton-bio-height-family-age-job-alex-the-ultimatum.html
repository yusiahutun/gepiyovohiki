As the reality show started, one person in every five different couples had been issued an ultimatum in their relationship. Kat Shelton and <a href=#>Alex Chapman</a> were one of these couples.</p><p>In the rest of the writing, we shall explore what happened to them and discuss all about Kat Shelton.</p><h3><strong>The Ultimatum Season 2: Are Kat Shelton And Alex Chapman Still Together?</strong></h3><p>According to what we can gather, Kat and Alex have undoubtedly resolved the most of their problems, allowing them to not only remain together but also become engaged and make plans for their future together.</p><p>As of 2023, it is not understood if Kat Shelton and Alex Chapman are still together. However, on social media, Kat Shelton looked quite happy about her journey on the show.</p><p>The stark differences in Kat and Alex’s personalities, nevertheless, eventually started to cause issues because they didn’t fit with how they really intended their lives to be in a few years. Although they both enjoy spontaneity and being outside, the rational second thought they needed more time, while the conflict-avoidant first made it plain she wanted to move to the next stage. He even went so far as to say that he needed someone to confront him rather than just give him the reins, not realizing that would make her become obstinate and give him an ultimatum.</p><p>“[Alex] never gives me a real answer…,” Kat candidly expressed in the series at one point before adding, “I don’t want to go three or four years and still be like, what’s going on? I’d rather know now.” He then essentially proved her point by stating, “We are this fun, adventure-loving couple who is skiing, surfing, traveling all over the place. I haven’t been able to propose because, seriously, we’ve been busy.”</p><p>However, it turns out that he is not afraid of marriage in general, especially after helping Roxanne Kaise, his trial wife, realize the advantages of marriage the way he has always viewed them owing to his parents.</p><p>The only concerns Alex had were whether or not he was personally ready for forever and whether or not he thought she was the one after recognizing Kat did challenge him in her own quiet manner once they reconnected. She further demonstrated that she was prepared by making it clear that Alex must express or demonstrate his love for her, giving him a decision to choose. She had finally learnt to speak her thoughts during her trial marriage to Antonio Mattei.</p><p>“Once you make [this final decision], you’re in. You have to be all-in; you have to stay all-in. It is make or break,” Alex later said, indicating he was still unsure of what he’d really do.</p><p>Prior to the show’s release, she took to the internet to gush “First comes love, then comes marriage…then comes “The Ultimatum: Marry Or Move On 2”. “Guess who got caught up in the ultimate adventure? 🤯🌟 I’m just as shocked as you are, but hey, life’s all about surprises, right?”, after writing this, she asked people to tune in to see if she gets engaged or moves on.</p><p>Kat and Alex were among the show’s dating app-turned-long-term-relationship instances. It was made known that they met on the app called Hinge!&nbsp;It was Kat who&nbsp;issued the ultimatum. To the viewers, she says, she is ready to take the relationship to the next level.</p><p>There were still lots of pictures of them on Kat’s social media. One of these, posted on 22 October 2021, was about Kat telling everyone the day marked their one-year anniversary. Sharing their first picture together, she gushed about having come a really long way.</p><p>Anyway, on this reality show that Kat went on, one person in all couples has been issued an ultimatum in their relationship. After that, the couples were seen coming together to enter “trial marriages” with other members of ultimatum-struck couples, and for eight weeks they were to see if they were ready to marry their OG partner or move on to something new. This time the season included all kinds of pairs, from high school sweethearts to dating app love dovies like Kat and Alex.</p><h3><strong>Kat Shelton Age</strong></h3><p>Kat, full name Kathryn E Shelton, was born in 1994.
