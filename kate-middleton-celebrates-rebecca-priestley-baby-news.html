Her duties included organising official programmes and engagements, and ensuring Kate was briefed on who she would meet. She also travelled all over the world with the Cambridges, joining them on tours to Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Prior to joining William and Kate's team, Rebecca worked for Prince Harry's charity Sentebale.</p><p id=ekLNKAb8uQ4y data-wc=58>Around the same time that she announced her resignation in spring 2017, Rebecca tied the knot with Adam in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace, an exclusive venue only available to those with a direct link to the royal family. The bride wore a beautiful cowl-necked wedding gown with her hair swept back in an elegant up-do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ef6e0d39af6f-kate-middleton-and-rebecca-deacon-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eKvkGslervDg data-wc=6><strong>Rebecca worked for Kate until 2017</strong></p><p id=eHBfCN5nODPa data-wc=49>A few months after she quit, Rebecca returned to the palace in October 2017 to be awarded the Royal Victorian Order at a Buckingham Palace investiture ceremony.

A listing filed by Companies House in 2017 showed Rebecca registered her own private company, RAP Consulting and Communications. The nature of the business falls under "public relations and communications activities" and the office is based in Fitzrovia, central London. Rebecca is listed as the director and "person with significant control", meaning she holds 75 per cent or more of the shares and voting rights in the company. She also has the right to appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors of the company, while her husband Adam is listed as the company director.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
