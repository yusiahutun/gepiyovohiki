Take a look at the television personality as she performed alongside former family member <a class=hm-link href=#>Reba McEntire</a> at the 2007 CMA Music Festival in Nashville, Tennessee in June. They were brought together at the time by family; previously, Reba was married to Narvel Blackstock until 2015 who is Kelly's ex-husband Brandon's dad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/10f91afd2ec7-kelly-clarkson-short-brunette-hair-2007.jpg><p id=eW1T_aezm1 data-wc=66>It seems Kelly has been encouraging her daughter River Rose, now eight, to have the same freedom with her hair. In 2020, the mom dyed her daughter’s hair purple when she was six years old. She wrote on Twitter at the time: "I put a purple streak in my daughter’s hair today and I swear to you she thinks she is as cool as Prince now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4faf3bb71827-kelly-clarkson-show-move.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0bbf092c2317-kelly-clarkson-brandon-d.jpg><p id=el_axbeZoV data-wc=96>"Full on air guitar, singing at the top of her lungs, that is what’s happening… and before I get attacked for being the worst mom ever, it's safe, organic paint." Having been mom-shamed before, Kelly was taking no chances on social media. Despite her fears, however, many fans wrote back to her with encouraging messages about River's new hair at the time. "Good for you, there’s nothing wrong with that," one fan wrote. "It's a shame that you even have to think about being attacked for doing that. When my daughter was younger we did pink!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/708cde45cc0f-gettyimages-1199103771.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e1422e6d29d2-the-kelly-clarkson-show.jpg><p id=eRFcLRCSMS data-wc=76>Kelly is also mom to her son Remington Alexander Blackstock, seven, and she co-parents both of her children with her ex-husband Brandon. Sadly, the couple went their separate ways in June 2020 after seven years of marriage. It was a hard decision for the lovebirds but they have begun to move on with their lives now.Candidly in March this year, Kelly opened up about her heartache and how the breakdown of her marriage "ripped her apart".&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/93cca9c26283-kelly-clarkson-performing-on-american-idol.jpg><p id=e9aNKnC6LGo data-wc=81>She told Angie Martinez's IRL podcast: "It rips you apart, whenever you fall in love with someone and it doesn't work. I think the thing about divorce - especially having it publicized, and people thinking they know the whole thing, the hardest part of that is it wasn't an overnight decision. Anyone who has been divorced knows that was years in trying to make, not make it work - I never wanted to be part of something to 'make it work'."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8c65bef0c89d-kelly-clarkson-with-brown-hair.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/31c13764f754-kelly-clarkson-show-pcas.jpg><p id=eg5aRCbfDq7 data-wc=6>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
