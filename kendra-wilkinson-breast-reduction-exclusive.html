When the &#34;Kendra on Top&#34; star hit the red carpet for the premiere of her series last week, she didn't realize she'd look so top-heavy, with her killer cleavage on full display in a skin-tight, extremely low-cut white jumpsuit.

I hate it. I thought I looked so cute walking out that door," she tells <strong>toofab</strong>, looking back. "Oh my god, one of the biggest regrets!"</p><p>"I love the look, but I don't think that look was made for me. I hate, ugh, I thought it was a cool premiere outfit but it ended up being ... it didn't work for me and I feel miserably," she adds.</p><p>The mother-of-two says she's still picking up tips for how to dress for her physique.</p><p>"I'm so sad because I should have dressed more appropriate, in stuff that would make me look like me," she continues.
