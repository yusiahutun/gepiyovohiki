The estate, which is located near Athens, Ga., includes its own private 18-hole golf course, an equestrian center, three private spring fed lakes, five guest houses and a clubhouse. Two swimming pools, two tennis courts and a 12,000-square-foot mansion also cover the property.</p><p>The country legend designed it all himself, and the land&nbsp;is now being offered to the highest bidder with most of its original décor and furnishings, according to a press release. "I have so many fond memories at Beaver Dam Farms," Rogers shares in a release.

Adams kept the original decor and&nbsp;ran the Farms&nbsp;as a family retreat for many years, but would eventually transition it into an inclusive resort. It's not clear how much of the decor and furnishings stemmed from Rogers' vision.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJ2eo8Zuvs6gnKurXZrAta3TnmSbnZGrsrN5w5qkZp6Rp7q0ecCumq2hn6N8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
