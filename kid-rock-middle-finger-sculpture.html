In December, Ted Pelkey of Westford, Vt., installed a wooden sculpture shaped like a hand flipping the bird on his property. WKRN-TV reports that the sculpture, which was carved from a 700-pound block of pine, sits atop a 16-foot pole and is lit up at night, to make it always visible, including from nearby Route 128, WCAX-TV reports."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The profane sign of protest, however, has become a tourist attraction — "It's visited every day," he says — has its own Facebook fan page, and caught the attention of Rock.</p><p><strong>Remember Who Originally Sang "Picture" With Kid Rock?</strong></p><p>Rock called Pelkey (he has the voicemail from the musician saved) to see if Pelkey could help Rock get his own middle finger statue. So, Pelkey reached out to the Vermont-based artist who made his, and the artist agreed to make a second. Pelkey and his wife are driving the sculpture down to Rock, too.</p><p>"It'll be covered up, I'm sure," Pelkey says of the road trip. "I'm sort of excited; it's going to be fun.</p><p>Rock's soon-arriving middle finger sculpture isn't the only attention-grabbing decor of his that's been in the headlines recently: In January, <a href=#>the sign for Rock's new Lower Broadway steakhouse and bar was approved</a>&nbsp;— but not with everyone's approval.
