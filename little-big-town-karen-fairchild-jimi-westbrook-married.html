"It was like, 'We're single. Let's get together.' She has a beautiful heart and she's absolutely gorgeous and I just love her dearly."</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">The musical couple got married in Nashville.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The couple complemented one another just as well as their musical talents do, and Karen and Jimi secretly married in a Nashville wedding on May 31, 2006—the same year their bandmate Kimberly remarried following her first husband's tragic death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"I think Jimi and I had a special friendship and connection that blossomed when we were both single," Karen said in a 2010 interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/little-big-town-discusses-their-major-ups-and-downs-2010279/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Us Weekly" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Us Weekly</a>.

"I knew there was a deep connection there but once you decide to be together, you find even more, and then to have a child together is a beautiful, beautiful thing for us to share and a dream come true." Now 13 years old, Elijah is a perfect combination of both his parents.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">After 17 years together, they still have a deep connection.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Karen and Jimi's chemistry has served them well on stage and in the studio, too. Little Big Town's song "Your Side of the Bed" features an incredible duet by the duo—and the music video is pretty sexy, too.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">That's not to say it's always easy, though. "It's challenging," Karen said to Us Weekly. "We are together 24 hours a day, so that is a very good thing and a very bad thing. If you need a break, there is nowhere to go, but the great thing about it is we get to enjoy this incredible journey with the band together."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"The band is like one big marriage," she continued. "You have to really be family and love each other to be in a band this long or you would have gone your separate ways. Kimberly and Philip both have their spouses out here with us a lot. They travel with us as much as they can. We keep the families on the road. Everyone has a child as well, so family is super important to the band."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">A little big family, indeed.</p><h6 class="css-5zz7ok e6pr2lz3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e6pr2lz1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-1s9owpq e19xk9rq1"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/5b13ab23-04f6-4c1c-a43e-6ded9235e3be_1521574058.jpg alt="Headshot of Taysha Murtaugh" title="Headshot of Taysha Murtaugh" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Taysha Murtaugh was the Lifestyle Editor at CountryLiving.com.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursZyew6q6xmeaqKVfobansY6epa2doqmuqrrMnqWtZ5FnfnGElGxscGecnsG1uMRmmaKfXam8uLqMpJirnZ5is6K10ZyfoqSUYrequchmrp6rpJe%2FsLvKZqSaqqKesqV7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
