"Nobody on stage really even batted an eye. It just seemed like it was part of the show. Nobody on stage was concerned, and so at that point we were just standing there. And then the first burst happened.”</p><p><strong>3 Route 91 Fest Stories You Need to Hear</strong></p><p>Pandemonium ensued, and the bursts of gunfire kept coming. Combs remained calm, as he wasn't sure what was happening.</p><p>“I’ve been around firearms, and it didn’t sound like gunfire to me. Then I was in the catering tent with a fan who had kind of wandered back, and we were both talking about how it wasn’t gunfire," he recalls,&nbsp;"But then we heard the next burst and it sounded like maybe [the gunman] had put a weapon out of the window, which would completely change the sound. At that point, this is 100 percent gunfire.”</p><p>In the moment, Combs wasn't sure if it was an attack targeting the festival or if it was violence going on in surrounding Las Vegas streets. One thing he is sure of: the festival shooting won't stop him from playing shows for his fans.</p><p><strong>The Faces and Stories of the Route 91 Victims</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpa2bmnqku8ybqmaqn6rBpnmYamSlmaNiw6azwKxkrKCfpMGqusZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
