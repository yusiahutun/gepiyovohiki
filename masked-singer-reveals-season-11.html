From Kevin Hart as Book to the unmaskings of more than a dozen other celebrities, The Masked Singer never disappoints, and Season 11 is no exception. Keep reading for The Masked Singer reveals on Season 11 thus far and see whether your guesses have been correct or as wildly off-base as the judges.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Masked Singer</a>—also abbreviated as TMS—is FOX’s reality TV singing competition series, where celebrities compete against each other in performances while wearing head-to-toe costumes and face masks to conceal their identities. Throughout the season, a panel of judges guess who the celebrities are based on their voices and clues provided before and after each performance. Each week, the contestant with the least amount of votes from a studio audience is sent home and takes off their mask to reveal their identity.</p><p>The Masked Singer is based on South Korea’s King of the Mask Singer, which follows a similar format. Since the premiere of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The King of the Mask Singer</a> in 2015, The Masked Singer has expanded to dozens of countries across the world including France, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Brazil.&nbsp;“It was flypaper TV right from the get-go,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Masked Singer</a> executive producer Craig Plestis told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2019 about why he wanted to produce the show in the United States. “I just knew right away this was a special show. It was unbelievable in its appeal — and the game play, spectacle, family-viewing…[and] it was this huge hit in Asia…. If we do the job here, it should work here.”</p><p>The Masked Singer premiered in 2019 with host Nick Cannon and judges Jenny McCarthy, Ken Jeong, Robin Thicke, and Nicole Scherzinger. Scherzinger was the first judge to leave following Season 10 and was replaced by singer Rita Ora, who was also a judge on <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://ew.com/rita-ora-the-masked-singer-nicole-scherzinger-taika-waititi-8598849>The Masked Singer UK</a> for five seasons.</p><p>“Of course I was familiar by doing the U.K. show for about five seasons, and when they asked me to do this one, I was so excited,” she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2024. “I just felt like a hundred percent [yes] because I already knew the show so well, and I just love it and I love the excitement of it. It’s just so crazy and it’s like a huge game show, and such a great family show. You can’t really go wrong. I mean, you may look crazy with the names you [guess], but who cares? Because the whole show is a bit bonkers anyway, so it doesn’t feel like work at all.”</p><p>Ora also told the magazine about whether she’s considered competing on The Masked Singer as a contestant instead of a judge. “I think that might be a conflict now because I feel like I know too much. I know the tricks, I know everything. I think it might not be fair,” she said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-masked-singer-reveals-on-season-11>The Masked Singer Reveals on Season 11</h2><p>But back to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/the-masked-singer-reveals-season-10/>The Masked Singer reveals on Season 11</a>.
