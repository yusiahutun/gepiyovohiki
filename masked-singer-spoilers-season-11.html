Vanessa Hudgens, an actress and singer best known for movies like the High School Musical franchise, is our best guess for Goldfish on The Masked Singer Season 11 based on her voice and clues. Read on for the clues that support Hudgens as Goldfish on The Masked Singer ahead.</p><p><strong>“Vampire” by Olivia Rodrigo (Week 1)</strong></p><p>Goldfish performed “Vampire” by Olivia Rodrigo in Week 1 of The Masked Singer Season 11, which was a clue to Hudgens. Rodrigo played Nini Salazar-Roberts in Disney Plus’ High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. In Season 1 of HSMTMTS, Nini played Hudgens’ High School Musical character, Gabriella Montez, in a high school production of the Disney Channel original movie.</p><p><strong>Posing from cameras and running away from them; paparazzi flashes; Hollywood can be a little “soul-sucking” (Week 1)</strong></p><p>Hudgens was in a high-profile relationship with her High School Musical co-star, Zac efron, from 2005 to 2010. “A sense of knowing I’m a part of something bigger than myself has allowed me to enjoy life more,” Hudgens told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marie Claire</a> in 2013 about the media attention she received during her relationship with Efron. “And not worry about the little things, like paparazzi.”</p><p><strong>Glass slipper (Week 1)</strong></p><p>A glass slipper is worn by Cinderella in Walt Disney’s 1950 movie Cinderella. Hudgens’ movie franchise, High School Musical, is also a Disney production and aired on Disney Channel. Cinderella, who is a princess, could also be a reference to Hudgens’ Netflix movie franchise, The Princess Switch.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>She could play it safe or dive into “deeper, darker, edgier waters” (Week 1)</strong></p><p>One of Hudgens’ first movies after the end of the High School Musical franchise was 2013 thriller The Frozen Ground,&nbsp; in which she played Cindy Paulson, a 17-year-old prostitute who escapes the murder of real-life Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen and helped lead police to his capture. “I mean it’s different from anything I’ve done but that’s the way I love it. I keep on doing these different parts – but she’s a girl who has very little self love, you know she, she’s just a survivor I really admire that about her,” Hudgens told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wonderland</a> magazine at the time about how the movie was different than the work on the Disney Channel.&nbsp;</p><p>Following High School Musical, Hudgens also starred in 2012’s Spring Breakers, in which she played a college student who goes to spring break in St. Petersburg, Florida, where she falls into the world of drugs, crime and violence, and 2013’s Gimme Shelter, in which she played a runaway teenage girl who becomes pregnant. “I think that’s what auditioning is for. I take pride in my auditions because people in general know me as Gabriella Montez, so not only do they not know what I can do, but they have a preconceived idea of who I am. So I auditioned for Gimme Shelter and Spring Breakers and won them fair and square. I think I showed my chops doing that,” Hudgens told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vanity Fair</a> in 2013.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfoq60t8SdZKyhnpyys3nSqaaipJWnwG6%2FxJqqqKZdZn5w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
