Much love.”</p><p>In true Joey fashion, LeBlanc ended his tribute with a light-hearted joke as he penned: “And I guess you’re keeping the 20 bucks you owe me.”</p><p>As fans took to X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a> to react to the emotional tribute, many linked it to a famous Friends scene.</p><p>In the season 5 episode, The One With The Kips, Monica pretends that Chandler stole a ’20’ from her purse when Joey walks in on her giving Chandler a cheque for the hotel they stayed in. At this point, Joey is unaware of their “secret relationship” but finds out at the end of the episode.</p><p>Joey then says to his roommate: “Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without 20s, and you, always have lots.”</p><p>Fans posted pictures of the scene on social media, as one wrote: “I didn’t need to see this in the morning, now I wanna cry”</p><p>“Crying in class right now,” said another.</p><p>Another heartbroken fan penned: “I was not ready for Joey bidding farewell to Chandler.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-friends-cast-attended-perry-s-funeral>The Friends cast attended Perry’s funeral</h2><p>All five of the main Friends cast, Jeniffer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc attended Perry’s funeral on November 3.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According</a> to TMZ, it was a small service, consisting of around 20 mourners, and took place a stone’s throw away from the Warner Bros.
