Neither Dickson or Robbie shared details about the scene in question, however.</p><p>Meanwhile, elsewhere in the article, Robbie also reflected on being the Mattel execs' first choice to play the famous doll in the film.</p><p>Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said he asked Robbie Brenner, the first EP of Mattel Films, who she wanted to star as Barbie in the movie, sharing that Brenner also chose Robbie.</p><p>"She's very funny, she's deep, she’s a fantastic actress, and she does look like …. She's beautiful," Brenner said.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>While she admitted that she was honored to be the first choice, Robbie said it was important to her that there were many different Barbies in the film, not just her.</p><p>"If [Mattel] hadn't made that change to have a multiplicity of Barbies, I don't think I would have wanted to attempt to make a Barbie film," she told TIME. "I don't think you should say, 'This is the one version of what Barbie is, and that's what women should aspire to be and look like and act like.'"</p><p>The Oscar nominee also addressed the ongoing discussion about whether to not the film can be considered a "feminist movie." While the TIME writer said Brenner and other Mattel executives described the Barbie as "not a feminist movie," Robbie appeared surprised.</p><p>"Who said that?" she asked, before sighing. "It's not that it is or it isn't. It's a movie. It's a movie that's got so much in it."</p><p>Robbie then stressed, "We're in on the joke. This isn't a Barbie puff piece."</p><p>It's safe to say Barbie is a highly-anticipated film, and the movie is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>predicted to earn</strong></a> $55 to $85 million on its opening weekend. And while Robbie revealed there have been "conversations" regarding a potential sequel, nothing has yet been made official.</p><p>"It could go a million different directions from this point," Robbie said. "But I think you fall into a bit of a trap if you try and set up a first movie whilst also planning for sequels."</p><p>Robbie graced the TIME cover alongside her Barbie co-stars Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Hari Nef and Alexandra Shipp. The ladies -- along with Gerwig -- also opened up to TIME about the film. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Read the full article, here.&nbsp;</strong></a></p><p>Barbie -- which hits theaters July 21 -- also stars <a href=#><strong>Ryan Gosling</strong></a> as Ken and <a href=#><strong>Will Ferrell</strong></a>, who plays the CEO of Mattel. The cast also Includes Simu Liu, Emma Mackey, Michael Cera and more.</p><p>Barbie hits theaters July 21.</p><a id=gallery-link-a3ca5e0d-2bab-4e4c-832c-74c59516ab26 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:a3ca5e0d-2bab-4e4c-832c-74c59516ab26 data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20230626_52916143069c40e1b9f1cca3d8ec2025 data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:d56107f2-d7ed-4756-b4ce-995fdec6f54b data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/52/4by3/2023/06/26/52916143069c40e1b9f1cca3d8ec2025_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29ma29foq61wMSlZJynn2KzrbHWZquoZZKWv6O1xGaqnqxdqbxurdGgrJ5lp57BqXnMmqmgp6Riv7CuwaKcZp%2BimsGiecaeqbChl2K8t7HRZqqcnZ6afA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
