However, he wanted to fulfill his wife’s desire.</p><p>Maury and Connie married after 7 years of on and off again dating. They got married in 1984.</p><p>Even after a 5-year long effort, they didn't have any good news. Even the efforts of in-vitro-fertilization were unsuccessful. So, the couple decided to go for an adoption, but still their months-long planned adoption was said to be falling through.</p><p>Luckily after&nbsp;2 years long struggle, they were awarded their child, Matthew. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Caption: Talk show host Maury Povich and his wife, journalist <a href=# rel=follow>Connie Chung</a> arrive at the 11th annual Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational gala on March 30, 2011</strong></p><p>Source: zimbio.com</p><p>His proper birth date and parents info were kept away from the media. However, according to the article published by nytimes.com on June 20, 1995, he is said to be adopted from a young unmarried California woman, and he was&nbsp;a 6-pound-12-ounce boy when adopted. This means his date of birth must be sometime around the same year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p>Maury Povich and his wife shared the good news on June 19, 1995, with a confirmation statement,</p><p>“We are happy to confirm that after a long period of waiting we have adopted a boy, Matthew Jay Povich.&nbsp;We are thrilled and ecstatic."</p><p>&nbsp;The new baby was circumcised in a traditional Jewish bris on June 16. The couple had been so private about this matter that not even friends were informed about it. Maury’s brother, David, who is also the child’s Godfather, also shared, “This wasn't the first time they tried. But this was the first time it worked."&nbsp;</p><h2>Biologically Related:</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Since Maury and Connie adopted Matthew, there is a very less chance that they are his biological parents. But ‘Empire News’ has claimed that Maury may be Matthew’s actual father.</p><p>It is stated in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a 2014 empirenews.net article</a>&nbsp;that it all started when Maury decided to take the DNA test on himself and Matthew to prove the professional blogger&nbsp;Mark Satterfield wrong on his accusations regarding the authenticity of the tests on his show.</p><p><strong>Caption: Top 10 Maury Povich Paternity Reaction Clips - Must see reactions</strong></p><p>“I believe in the integrity of the&nbsp;Maury&nbsp;show, so what better way to put my credibility and professional honor on the line? “I personally invited Mr. Satterfield to be a part of the studio audience, and I wanted him to read the test results himself.&nbsp; I asked my adopted son if he would volunteer a sample of his DNA, which he agreed to do.”</p><p>Povich on inviting the blogger on his show</p><p>The crowd remained baffled when Maury read the results inside the envelope quoting his famous line, “In the case of your adopted son, … Maury, … You …&nbsp;ARE&nbsp;the father!”. Currently, more investigation has been going on.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Since Maury went on to confirm that he donated his sperms several years ago when he needed a quick cash during the time when ratings were going down, the probability of the father-son being directly related still stands at 99.99 percent.</p><p>However, we seriously doubt the authenticity of this entire story. Such a shocking discovery should have made the headlines, or a follow-up had to be written on this matter if it was true. But there are no other related stories to it, so it is more likely to be false.</p><h2>Matthew Jay Povich's Short Bio:</h2><p>Matthew Jay Povich was adopted in 1995 by journalists parents,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Maury Povich</a> and <a href=# rel=follow>Connie Chung</a>.
