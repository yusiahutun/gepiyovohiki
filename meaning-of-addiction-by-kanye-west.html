The song explores how people are drawn to things that are considered "bad" but bring immense satisfaction. It touches on the addictive nature of various vices, such as money, women, and drugs. While these themes are not uncommon in music, Kanye's take on them offers a unique perspective that goes beyond the surface level.One standout lyric is, "Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?" This line suggests that there is something inherently alluring about indulging in forbidden pleasures. It challenges the conventional understanding of right and wrong, implying that what society may perceive as negative can actually bring joy and fulfillment to individuals. This theme of contradicting expectations sets the tone for the rest of the song.Another significant lyric is, "She's got a lover, so the lies and the lust is a rush." This line not only explores the allure of infidelity but also touches on the thrill of secrecy. It highlights how engaging in forbidden relationships can create an adrenaline rush and intensify desire. The theme of secrecy adds a layer of complexity to the song, as it explores the hidden aspects of addiction and how they can magnify its appeal."I see the emotion in your eyes, that you try not to show. We get the closest when you're high, or you're drunk, or you blow," is yet another impactful lyric. It delves into the idea that people often reveal their true selves when they are under the influence of substances. It suggests that in these vulnerable states, individuals can experience true connections and emotional intimacy. This theme challenges the notion that substances only provide superficial pleasure and instead suggests that they can facilitate genuine connections, even if temporary.The chorus, with its repetition of the line, "You make me smile," emphasizes the addictive nature of the subjects being discussed throughout the song. It suggests that despite recognizing the negative consequences associated with indulging in these vices, individuals find it difficult to resist their allure. The theme of addiction is further reinforced through the use of drug-related metaphors, such as "rolling up the doge" and "coming over." These metaphors illustrate how dependency on substances or behaviors can take control and lead to an ongoing cycle.Overall, "Addiction" raises thought-provoking questions about the nature of human desires and the tension between what society deems as right or wrong. It challenges the idea of absolute morality and explores the complexities of temptation and indulgence. While some lyrics might appear straightforward, a closer examination reveals intricate themes that explore the psychology behind addiction and the potential for unexpected connections and personal growth in unconventional ways.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonysrc2ynGavlajBcLnEmqWippdivKd5wJ2bopuknryvecGyZKSZnq6ybsPErKs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
