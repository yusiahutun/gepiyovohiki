One of their most notable songs, 'Cemetry Gates,' is a prime example of their ability to weave complex themes into their music. Released in 1986 as part of the album 'The Queen Is Dead,' this song delves deep into the realms of mortality, literary inspirations, and the quest for personal identity.At its core, 'Cemetry Gates' revolves around the contemplation of life's brevity and the inevitability of death. The opening line, "A dreaded sunny day, so I meet you at the cemetery gates," sets the tone for the entire song. This juxtaposition of 'dreaded' and 'sunny' reflects the irony of facing mortality in the midst of a beautiful day, hinting at the contradictory nature of existence.Throughout the song, Morrissey draws inspiration from literary giants, placing Keats, Yeats, and Wilde on a pedestal. These references not only serve as a tribute to cherished writers but also delve into the power of art and literature in shaping our identity. By aligning oneself with these literary figures, the protagonist strives to transcend death by immersing themselves in the immortal realm of literature.One standout lyric that aligns with this theme is, "If you must write prose and poems, the words you use should be your own, don't plagiarize or take 'on loan.'" While seemingly a remark on originality, it also speaks to the artist's search for individuality and authenticity, challenging the listener to find their own voice amidst the vast sea of influences. Thus, this theme harmonizes with the overarching idea of identity and self-discovery.Expanding on the theme of identity, another notable line in the song is, "With loves, with hates and passions just like mine, they were born, and then they lived, and then they died." This lyric emphasizes the fleeting nature of life and reminds the audience that while we may share universal experiences, each individual is still unique. Morrissey prompts us to reflect on our own passions and how they contribute to our identity, urging us to value our individuality in the face of mortality.Furthermore, the refrain, "You say, 'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn," and "You say, 'Ere long done do does did'" highlights the concept of borrowed knowledge and false expertise. Rather than seeking original insights, the protagonist warns against using borrowed words as a facade of intellectualism. This sentiment is crucial in the search for authenticity and urges the listener to be wary of surface-level understanding and to seek genuine knowledge and experiences.Overall, 'Cemetry Gates' can be viewed as a profound meditation on the fragile nature of existence, the power of literature to shape our identities, and the importance of cultivating originality in an increasingly interconnected world. The song delves into various unexpected and imaginative themes, intertwining literature, self-expression, and mortality to provoke introspection and reflection in the listener.Morrissey's poignant lyrics, combined with the intricate melodies created by Johnny Marr and the band's distinctive sound, make 'Cemetry Gates' a timeless piece of musical genius. It serves as a reminder to cherish our passions, cultivate our authentic selves, and find solace in the pages of literature as we navigate the journey from birth to death, ultimately leaving an indelible mark on the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufony1tMRmqqahpJ3AcLnEmqWippdivKd5wp6knqyirnqordOeqmakmauybrXNZqOoppSku259mHFtZpqpYsGpsYyspKKsmKg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
