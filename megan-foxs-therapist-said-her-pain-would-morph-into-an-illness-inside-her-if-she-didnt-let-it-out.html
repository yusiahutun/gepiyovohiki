I wish I loved attention. I would have the best life. I would have so much fun, I have so many opportunities,” she said in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a> with WWD.</p><p>However, she then revealed her “crippling anxiety” stops her from doing these things. “I could be doing so many things, but instead, I have crippling anxiety and I never want to leave my house.”</p><p>Opening up more about her mental <a href=#>health</a> to the publication, she revealed she experienced her first panic attack, brought on by the <a href=#>exposure of the book</a>. In it, she wrote about many personal situations, such as abusive relationships and a recent miscarriage.</p><p>However, she reveals the hard part wasn’t writing them, it was going through them. And Megan Fox’s therapist had a very deep message for her on letting her emotions out.</p><p>“She was told by a therapist that if she continued to hold in the pain it would turn into an illness inside her; the only way was to expel it,” the publication writes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-sports-a-number-of-looks-for-the-publication>The star sports a number of looks for the publication</h2><p>After the release of the hard-hitting interview, the 37-year-old took to her <a href=#>Instagram</a> posting a number of looks, proving she can rock just about anything.</p><p>From a floor-length trench coat to a black turtle-neck, Megan’s new <a href=#>bright red bob</a> makes every outfit pop.</p><p>“What’s it like to be one of the most intriguing people on earth?” questioned one fan.</p><p>Another exclaimed: “YES MISS MEGAN!”</p><p><strong>For immediate grief support, call 1-800-221-7437 First Candle.
