So happy for you,” wrote Paris Hilton, who had her first son earlier this year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans are confused about Meghan Trainor’s son’s last name</h2><p>Traditionally, children take their Father’s last name, which has left a few fans confused in the Instagram comments.</p><p>“No disrespect. Why does the baby have your last name?” questioned one fan.</p><p>“Apparently Riley has Sabara as a surname. I’ve seen some parents split surnames before. She’s said in interviews she wanted 4. So maybe they will have two with her surname and two with his surname,” guessed one fan.</p><p>“Makes more sense for the child to have the woman’s last name tbh I mean they’re the ones who carry them for 9 months and give birth,” wrote another.</p><p>Another penned: “It’s not uncommon these days for kids to have their mum’s last name. Mine all have mine.”</p><p>However, other fans were telling users it was ‘none of their business’ what the couple decided to name their son, although others said they ‘had the same question.’</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-couple-s-relationship-timeline>The couple’s relationship timeline</h2><p>As mentioned in the post, Meghan and Daryl had their first date seven years ago, and tied the knot in 2018, on Trainor’s 25th birthday.</p><p>The couple met at a house party in 2014, although they didn’t actually date until two years later after being set up on a date by Chloë Grace Moretz.</p><p>Daryl Sabara is a famous American actor, who has played roles in the Spy Kids <a href=#>movie</a> franchise, The Polar Express, and also featured on Disney’s Wizards of Waverly Place.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlvX2WCcLnEoJ%2Bapl2pv6K1zaipZp%2BZq7K0ecGiqa2gXam8bq3DqKmampyaeqOtwbJkm6epYq%2B2wIyfmKerXZm2t7XDnptmp6aav26wyJ%2BdnqqVo8FuusCmnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
