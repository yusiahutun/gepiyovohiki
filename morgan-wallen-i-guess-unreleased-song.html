Now he's back with another dark, twisted storytelling song.
Wallen teased an unreleased track on his social media over the weekend, pairing raw, demo-style production with a painful story about love going south. In its lyrics, Wallen's lover is constantly putting him down as the destructive one in the relationship — but he knows better than to take all the blame."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In its lyrics, Wallen's lover is constantly putting him down as the destructive one in the relationship — but he knows better than to take all the blame.</p><p>"And how do you explain / Ever falling in love with a guy like me / In the first place? / Turn around and say that I'm the worst thing," he sings in a clip.</p><p>"I guess I'm the problem / And you're Miss Never Do No Wrong / If I'm so awful / Then why'd you stick around this long? / And if it's the whiskey / Then why you keep on pulling it off the shelf? / You hate that when you look at me you halfway see yourself," Wallen continues in the chorus. "It got me thinking / If I'm the problem / You might be the reason."</p><p>It's not entirely clear from the minute-long teaser what the title of Wallen's unreleased song is, but it's a fair bet that it's called "I Guess." That's what the singer wrote in the caption of his post, and in the comments section, fellow country artist <a href=#>Ernest</a>&nbsp;— a friend and frequent tourmate of Wallen's, who often writes with or for him, too — echoed it back.</p><p>Along with the 660,000-and-counting fans who liked the post, a number of country singers chimed in with positive things to say about the song. <a href=#>Randy Houser</a> simply posted two "fire" emojis.</p><p>"Release that exactly how it is. So good," <a href=#>Parker McCollum</a> urged Wallen.</p><p>The singer's last full-length album was One Thing at a Time, which came out in March 2023. Wallen's been busy touring and releasing singles off that project all year, and the momentum of One Thing at a Time isn't showing signs of slowing down yet: In fact, the album<a href=#> just returned to the top of the Billboard 200 albums chart this week.</a></p><p>Still, it's always a possibility that Wallen could be planning new music, or simply working on writing and recording music for an album in the future.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>The Top 40 Country Songs of 2023, Ranked</h2><p>The best country songs of 2023 fit snugly over your life and experiences.
