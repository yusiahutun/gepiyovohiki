Shortly after becoming engaged to my now-husband, we were at a family buffet party, where everything was homemade and beautifully displayed. It was at their party that I first encountered the noodle pudding. I thought this was the <u>best</u> food I had ever tasted.</p><p><a title="getting the batter fluffy" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3085/2916360286_09119e736e_z.jpg alt="getting the batter fluffy" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>I asked a relative for the recipe on the spot. There was a lot of commotion amongst the people at the party that day, and as I have been telling my daughters for the past 30 years, the aunt told me that I would have to marry my now-husband to get the recipe. The rest is history.</p><p>I have often stated that if I were stranded on an island and could only take one food with me, it would be <u>this</u> version of noodle pudding. You be the judge.</p><p><a title="noodle kugel" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3247/2916367146_c881956883_z.jpg alt="noodle kugel" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>Previous guest posters:</b> <a href=#>Jocelyn</a>, <a href=#>Molly</a> and <a href=#>Deb’s dad</a></p><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>Hello Dolly Bars</a><br><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>Lemon Pound Cake</a></p><p><b>My Family’s Noodle Kugel</b></p><p>1 pound wide egg noodles<br>8 eggs<br>2 cups sugar (Mom uses 1 1/2 cups)<br>2 pounds full-fat cottage cheese, creamed or large curd<br>2 sticks (1 cup or 8 ounces) melted unsalted butter or margarine (Mom uses 1 1/2 sticks butter)<br>2 teaspoons vanilla<br>Dash of salt</p><p>Optional: 2 cups canned cherry pie filling (Comstock is specified)</p><p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Parboil the noodles (five to seven minutes).</p><p>In a very large bowl beat eggs until fluffy. Add the sugar gradually, then the cottage cheese, margarine or butter and vanilla. Stir in the drained noodles.</p><p>Pour into a 9×13-inch pan. Bake for 1 1/2 hours, or until kugel is set. If using the cherry pie filling as a topping, pour it over at the one-hour mark, then bake it for an additional 30 minutes.</p><p><strong>Deb note: </strong>Your baking time may, of course, vary. Check for doneness at one hour and go from there. Our oven, always running cool, took almost two hours to bake this. At home, my mothers inferno of an oven does it in an hour.</p><p><strong>About the topping:</strong> Okay, so apparently, the original version of this recipe has the cherry pie filling (from! a! can!) as a topping and apparently, my father says that some segments of my family still bake it this way. I have yet to see it, and my mother has never used it. Should you want to try some version of this but avoid the mystery-in-a-can stuff, a quick cherry pie filling can be made with a bag of frozen sour cherries cooked with half a cup of water in a saucepan for about 10 minutes. Mix 1/2 cup of sugar with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and stir these into the pot. The mixture will thicken within a couple minutes. Cool before using.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-860 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-860 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
