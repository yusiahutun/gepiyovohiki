All things to help women &nbsp;look easy, comfortable, and fabulous, according to Leakes.</p><p>“There are a lot of curvy women in my family, and we’re tall, so this was personal. I wanted pieces that you could pop on in the morning and look great in. That was my inspiration,” she said.</p><p>Plus, women have been asking Leakes—who’s 5’10—for style advice for years.&nbsp;“On social media, tall women are constantly asking me, ‘Where did you get those pants?’ Or women who are curvier&nbsp;ask me, ‘I’m a size 18 where can I get that shirt in my size?’ and I [didn’t]&nbsp;really know.&nbsp;They think I’m a size 16 or 20 because I apparently look larger on TV.”</p><p>Even though Leakes is a size 10 in real life, the HSN line will&nbsp;thrill all her fans—sizes range from&nbsp;2 to 24.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/pr1404_0001_nene_leakes.jpg><p>The&nbsp;accessible&nbsp;line fits right in with the reality star’s&nbsp;philosophy around shopping: “I don’t buy everything designer,” she said. “I’m always in TJ Maxx. It’s not far from where I live and I go all of the time. I shop better when there’s a sale. I don’t want to buy something for $3,800 and wear it one time.”</p><p>Leakes started her design process&nbsp;by pulling things from her closet for inspiration. After it was completed she reached out to some famous friends for advice, including&nbsp;<strong>Joan Rivers</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Giuliana Rancic</strong>. “Joan is such a hot mess, but has had such a great business for a very long time, and she really told me how much work this was going to be. Giuliana told me to be very hands-on and to try on every piece. I listened. I tried on every piece to see how they moved, how they worked in my closet.”</p><p>While Leakes might love shopping, apparently getting ready for red carpet appearances&nbsp;isn’t one of her passions. “I’m not a fan of the red carpet. It’s a lot of stress. It’s worse than getting ready for prom. You have to get your teeth whitened, you have to put lotion on your fingers, oh god. You need a whole team, it’s super-expensive, everyone is judging you, and you need to be perfect—from your nail polish down to your panty lines.” Leakes added: “I do love wearing gowns. Not a lot of women get to wear gowns. Getting dressed up for the Emmys? That was just so amazing.”</p><p>As for her&nbsp;ultimate fashion tip for women? “So many women are just dressing wrong. If you have a great pair of legs, you should know you have a great pair of legs, if you have great arms, show off your great arms.”</p><p>Naturally, we couldn’t let NeNe go without asking&nbsp;one question about her fellow Housewives, so we wanted to know: Who’s the best dressed, and who’s the worst?</p><p>“I’m obviously the best dressed housewife,” the characteristically confident Leakes shared. As for the worst? “I can’t tell you,” she told us with a laugh. “Though I do have someone in mind.”</p><p>NeNe NeNe Leakes launches on HSN and HSN.com on July 28.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ynrdKhoKimX2eBeIGTcGannZ6aeq2xwKScrGWfo3qpsdFmn6ymXZuutLTIqKVmpJmjsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
