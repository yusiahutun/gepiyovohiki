The <a href=#>Big Little Lies</a> star has opened up tons of times in the past about her journey through motherhood. The <a href=#>Golden Globe</a> winner is the loving mom of her two daughters, <a href=#>Sunday Rose</a> and <a href=#>Faith Margaret,</a> whom she shares with husband <a href=#><strong>Keith Urban</strong></a>, as well as <a href=#>her older children</a>, <a href=#><strong>Isabella Cruise</strong></a> and <strong><a href=#>Connor Cruise</a></strong>, from her previous marriage to ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Tom Cruise</strong></a>.</p><p>“Whether you’re an adoptive mother, a foster mother or a biological mother,” she gushed to <a href=#>Magic FM</a> in 2014, “it’s the emotion of attaching to a child and helping guide them [that’s important].”</p><p>Nicole loves sharing sweet photos of her kids on social media. In July 2021, she rang in Sunday’s birthday by <a href=#>posting a rare photo</a> during her celebration. “Happy happy birthday, Sunday! We love you so much — yum yum!” she wrote in the caption. The year earlier, Nicole posted of photo of the mother-daughter duo hugging.</p><p>When Nicole isn’t on set for his next biggest film or traveling the world for her Hollywood career, you can find her spending time at home with her little ones. During those moments, the Undoing star makes sure to pass down all of her life lessons to her children.</p><p>“I once got this wonderful advice from my grandmother,” the Bombshell actress told <a href=#>Tatler</a> magazine in January 2019. “She said, ‘Every child is given some adversity. Where you’re born. What you’re up against. Your parents get divorced. There’s always going to be problems. And the greatest thing is that the love is enough.'”</p><p>If Nicole’s kids ever have any problems of their own, they know they can always go to their mom for advice. The star loves teaching her kids about the world by going on lovely vacations or just having a <a href=#>great day in the park near their house</a>.</p><p>“When they’re older, they’ll probably think, ‘My parents dragged me [everywhere]. I’m never leaving this one town,'” she joked about going places with her children. But after realizing “kids can be quixotic” and sometimes “perverse,” Nicole learned her kids were teaching her a lot about motherhood.</p><p>“There’s nothing you love more,” she gushed. “When that shift happens, and you [become a parent], it’s a cataclysmic change. Everything shifts. That depth of love is unfathomable and deeply painful and extraordinarily joyful.’”</p><p><strong>Scroll below to see Nicole’s most candid quotes about motherhood!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46noJynnJp6rLXDppinZZuesbR5wJyrq52jqHqkwdOeqq1loaq8tbHSZpibp6Wpeq6706Gcq6CfpLFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
