So, I took a chance and added it to my routine. Aside from the price, I was also intrigued by its claim to be “long-lasting” —&nbsp;up to 16 hours! — and “flake-resistant,” not to mention cruelty-free.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$9; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The brow glue comes in 5 shades from light brown to black, as well as a clear option. To keep things simple, I opted for the clear shade first. I was a little disappointed that the tube is on the smaller side, but quickly found out the brush picks up just enough product to create the appearance of fuller brows. After a mishap where I shaved my eyebrows when I was younger, they’re now on the thinner side, and although I don’t mind going into public without any product on them, sometimes I want to achieve the appearance of fuller brows. That’s what I love about this eyebrow glue; not only does it lift my brows, but it also seems to fill in the sparse gaps, giving me the effortless, full look I desire.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$9; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What’s even better is that it doesn’t add a lot of time to my makeup routine; after putting on a medium-wear foundation, a touch of concealer and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>pore-blurring setting powder</a>, I quickly swipe the gel on my eyebrows to help frame my face. Unsurprisingly, I’m not the only one who feels this way —&nbsp;Nyx’s Brow Glue has 10,500 five-star ratings on Amazon. One <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">56-year-old shopper</a> raved that their brows “now have better appearance and a natural design” thanks to the product, something they “have not been able to achieve in many years.” Others love that it keeps their brows in place “all day” and even gives “<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">brow lamination dupe</a>” results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For just $9, you need <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Nyx Cosmetics’ eyebrow gel</a> if you’re looking for an easy, fool-proof way to style your brows — trust me.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zbKvZpufqLqmwMicqmaaoqTEbrPLrpxmqpWrtqbDjHBqcGhma4Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
