(The condition is called skin atrophy, and, yes, it’s as unappealing as it sounds.) As a result, I can’t so much as look at a bottle of exfoliating acid without breaking out, and my daily routine is simple: I cleanse with the aforementioned manuka honey, pat on a bit of jojoba oil, and that’s basically it. The thought of adding a luxurious, Ayurvedic oil to the mix without adding to my barrier’s burden? It was exciting enough that I bought my belly button a half-ounce, $45 oil of its very own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The first thing to note about UMA’s Beauty Boosting Oil is that it is tiny. When it arrived, I double-checked to make sure I didn’t accidentally order the sample size. (I didn’t.) A little does go a long way, though. Only one drop is needed per night, every night, which effectively fills my navel cavity to the brim.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Night one, I wasn’t quite sure what to do with it—lie down and let it soak in? Rub the oil over my abs? So I consulted UMA’s site for guidance. “Gently massage the skin around the belly button using your finger and thumb, using a gentle pinching motion for about one minute,” it read. “Use a small ball of cotton on the belly button to prevent staining of clothes. Leave on overnight.” I massaged, pinched, and since I’m not precious about my pj’s, skipped the cotton ball and went to bed. (I swear I dreamed about how good this stuff smells. It’s earthy but also citrusy sweet, with just a hint of mustard spice.)</p><img alt="Face, Black, White, Black-and-white, Head, Skin, Lip, Monochrome photography, Nose, Light, " title="Face, Black, White, Black-and-white, Head, Skin, Lip, Monochrome photography, Nose, Light, " width=5130 height=3420 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-169276989-1576002695.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">WIN-Initiative</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Holecek warned that I probably wouldn’t see results for at least a week, so I spared myself the morning skin inspection. But around day four, I noticed something, uh, unexpected, to say the least. My chronically bloated stomach seemed less bloated, and my bathroom situation was, in a word, better. Musavvir isn’t surprised; she tells me the combination of transdermal castor oil and stomach massage “is thought to strengthen digestion by allowing for better breakdown of food, improved assimilation of nutrients, and more efficient detoxification”—an elegant way of saying “relieves constipation.” (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=an%20examination%20of%20the%20effects%20of%20castor%20oil%20packs%20on%20constipation%20in%20the%20elderly&cmd=correctspelling" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Scientific studies" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Scientific studies</u></a> support this too.)

My face looked relatively normal (dry skin, chin dotted with acne) for the first couple weeks. Toward the end of week two, my lips started feeling supersoft—which, as someone who lives in the desert of Southern California, is not something I say lightly or often. “I always struggled with very chapped lips as a child, to the point that they'd bleed from my picking at them,” Holecek shares. She thinks navel oiling helped the situation (she’s been practicing since childhood), and I think she may be right.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The revelation bolstered my faith in belly button oil. From there, small, subtle changes seemed to appear every few days. A dry patch was suddenly smooth, my chin was unusually clear, my cheeks looked … plump? Bouncy even? “Think of your body creating more and better-quality hyaluronic acid, allowing your skin to feel naturally plumped,” the founder explains. “It’s better able to protect itself against damage and bacteria, effectively leading to clearer skin over time.” A month later, I’m a full-on believer in the link between belly buttons and beauty.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Navel Therapy Oil has since become part of my core skin care collection (pun always intended), and I find I love the nightly tummy rub just as much as the slightly glowier skin. The ritual of it—squeezing the dropper, inhaling the scent, the familiar rub-pinch-rub motion of the massage—keeps me coming back, which could be the key. “Ayurveda is all about finding balance within your body, and finding balance within your body looks different for everyone—but to truly find it, you must be consistent with your practice,” as Rose says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Alas, dermatologists in the West are (unsurprisingly) not sold on navel oil … but they’re not necessarily opposed to it either. “According to what we know in Western medicine, treatment of the belly button is not directly related to the face,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/joshzeichnermd/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Joshua Zeichner" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Joshua Zeichner</u></a>, MD, FAAD, the director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital, tells me over email. “But if oiling the belly button has been beneficial for you, then I would not discourage the practice.” His skepticism reads through the screen; I can tell he thinks it’s a strange thing to do in the name of skin care. But then again, that is kind of my thing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqyjmaN6pK3Rnmaaa2BmhHN%2Bl25mqKGcYravecGeo6WxXZfCtcDOp2SmsaSdfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
