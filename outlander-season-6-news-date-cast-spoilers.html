Men lie dead in the streets of Boston, and in the backwoods of North Carolina, isolated cabins burn in the forest.<p>With chaos brewing, the governor calls upon Jamie Fraser to unite the backcountry and safeguard the colony for King and Crown. But from his wife Jamie knows that three years hence the shot heard round the world will be fired, and the result will be independence—with those loyal to the King either dead or in exile. And there is also the matter of a tiny clipping from The Wilmington Gazette, dated 1776, which reports Jamie’s death, along with his kin. For once, he hopes, his time-traveling family may be wrong about the future.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But, if you are looking for spoilers, a

There's going to be a revolution with them as well, and I think that's what's going on throughout the season: You have a foundation and when that foundation is shaken and there is a revolution, you have to deal with it.

"I don't belong here. Brianna, Roger, they don't belong here. But yet here we are – all of us. Because I love you.
