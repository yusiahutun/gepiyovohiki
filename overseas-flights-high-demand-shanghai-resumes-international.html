He is flying out a few weeks ahead of the start of the new term in mid-July to make preparations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Demand for international flights is expected to increase in coming months after universities in popular destinations for Chinese students – such as the UK, US and Australia – announced schedules to restart offline classes for the new term in August and September, as the countries brought the impact of Covid-19 under control.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Thursday, Air China, one of the country’s major airlines, said it has resumed weekly flights to Stockholm, Milan, Madrid, Warsaw, Manila, Dubai, Phnom Penh and Kathmandu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/30/b194889c-4220-4fdf-a98a-3fea794444e4_a84eab21.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still, flights overseas remain very limited. Only about 10 international flights were scheduled out of Pudong airport on Wednesday, compared with dozens of domestic flights departing the same day.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although most other countries have opened up to overseas travel, China maintains strict restrictions for such travellers. According to official policy, Chinese citizens are discouraged from travelling abroad unless “necessary”, which in practice has ruled out outbound trips for tourism or leisure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All outbound travellers need to present negative nucleic acid tests taken within 48 hours as well as valid air tickets to enter airport terminals.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhu Jiaren, a 23-year-old Shanghai resident set to begin study in July for her literature arts degree at the University of Edinburgh, said she had to cancel her flight twice before boarding on Wednesday. She was not able to get a UK visa until Tuesday because the local application process was suspended during the two months of lockdown in the city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m one of the luckiest [among Chinese students] as I got my visa just in time, otherwise I would have had to cancel the flight a third time,” said Zhu.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eric Zhang, a 24-year-old who studies engineering at the University of Melbourne said, “I’ve been taking online classes for so long that I’m almost dumb.” He drove for hours from Nanjing city in neighbouring Jiangsu province to catch a flight on Wednesday night.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Shanghai Disneyland to reopen on June 30 as city’s life normalises</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The desire to leave is shared by expatriates in the country, who faced additional difficulties living under China’s rigid Covid-19 restrictions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sarah, a 30-year-old German who has worked in Shenyang city in northeastern Liaoning province over the past three years, said she experienced difficulties using the digital Covid pass operated by Liaoning authorities, which was more complicated for expats to apply for.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Declining to give her surname due to privacy reasons, Sarah also found it inconvenient to travel to other Chinese cities given the various local restrictions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It will be a relief to meet with my family again,” Sarah told the Post at the airport. “With the pandemic ongoing [in China], everything is getting more and more difficult. I never expected this when I first came here [in 2019],” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfmLWqusBmma6rmaOytL%2BOmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkHFqb25hZLy3sdGsnJqrXZu5qrPHrapmoJmctW6wxKaYp5xdqLWiusahmKJloprAtrnErGSipqSav6%2Bt06Kmp5mc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
