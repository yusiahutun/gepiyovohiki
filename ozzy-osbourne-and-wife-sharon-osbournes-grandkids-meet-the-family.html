The “Crazy Train” crooner and the </span><a href=#><i><span>Talk</span></i></a><span> alum may have their hands full as A-list stars, but the two are willing to drop anything when it comes to their four granddaughters: Pearl, Andy, Minnie and Maple.</span></p><p><span>Sharon and Ozzy tied the knot in 1982 and are the proud mom and dad of their </span><a href=#><span>three kids</span></a><span>, </span><a href=#><b>Aimee Osbourne</b></a><span>, </span><a href=#><b>Kelly Osbourne</b></a><span> and </span><a href=#><b>Jack Osbourne</b></a><span>. Jack shares his eldest three kiddos with his ex-wife, </span><b>Lisa Stelly</b><span>. In July 2022, he announced the arrival of his youngest daughter, Maple, whom he shares with fiancée </span><b>Aree Gearhart</b><span>.</span></p><p><span>Since Jack welcomed his little ones into their famous family, Sharon and Ozzy couldn’t be more thrilled to take on the role of grandparents. At the time the </span><i><span>Haunted Highway</span></i><span> host and his ex gave birth to their eldest child in 2012, the former music executive gushed over the “amazing” experience.</span></p><p><span>“It’s all overwhelming. But in a good way — in a really positive, lovely way,” Sharon told </span><a href=#><i><span>People</span></i></a><span> at the time. “You go through every emotion. You go through joy, and you thank God that everybody is healthy and happy. You realize how lucky you are. It’s like life has gone full cycle in our family.”</span></p><p><span>The British TV personality dished she wasn’t the only one thrilled about the arrival. “[Ozzy told Jack,] this is a love that is so special,” Sharon marveled at her longtime husband. “He said, ‘You will never experience a love like this, other than a father and a daughter. It’s a very, very special love.’”</span></p><p><span>Considering the former </span><i><span>Osbournes</span></i><span> star is so in love with Pearl, Andy, Minnie and Maple, it’s no surprise she was looking forward to the day Aimee or Kelly started families of their own. “I’ve got two more girls to marry off,” she sweetly joked. “There will be more grandkids!”</span></p><p><span>Sharon was delighted when Kelly announced on Instagram that she was expecting her first child in May 2022.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I know that I have been very quiet these past few months so I thought I would share with you all as to why … I am over the moon to announce that I am going to be a Mumma. To say that I am happy does not quite cut it. I am ecstatic!” the </span><i><span>Fashion Police</span></i><span> host captioned a photo holding up a sonogram.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In addition to Pearl, Andy, Minnie and Maple, Ozzy is also the </span><a href=#><span>grandfather</span></a><span> of his other grandchildren, Maia, Harry, Elijah, Isabelle and Kitty, through his older kids. Prior to meeting Sharon, he started a family with his ex-wife, </span><b>Thelma Riley</b><span>. The former duo were married from 1971 to 1982 and became the parents of their children, </span><b>Elliot Kingsley</b><span>, </span><b>Jessica Osbourne</b><span> and </span><b>Louis Osbourne</b><span>.</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to meet all of Ozzy and Sharon’s grandchildren.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46osbOxXaTAo7vUq6WeZZGjsW7DyJ%2BcZquYlr%2Bwuoyoqpunpae7pr%2BMoKmappSgtqW%2FjKacnqxdqbWmecWapKKkqWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
