It will need a formal scientific description before it is confirmed as a new species.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“It’s a really beautiful thing,” said Dr João Araújo, a Brazilian mycologist with the<a href=# data-link-name="in body link"> New York Botanical Garden</a>, who made the discovery but has not yet decided on a name. “They infect trapdoor spiders, and it’s one of the very few cordyceps that are purple, which is a cool feature.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“We don’t know much about this fungal group because it’s very understudied. This kind of fungus has been collected very few times in the world, mostly in Thailand. This will likely be the first time we sequence a species like this from Brazil.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The Atlantic rainforest is one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world. It once covered 15% of Brazil but has become highly fragmented, with <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">only 20% of the original area now left</a>. A biodiversity hotspot, it boasts several species that are found nowhere else on Earth, including the golden lion tamarin monkey and the painted tree rat.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The expedition, which was a collaboration between Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, the New York Botanical Garden, Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden and other organisations, included experts on plants, fungi, frogs, snakes and birds who wanted to see what remained in the forest. Scientists used the latest portable technology to sequence the genome of the fungus on site.</p><figure id=f5b84f4d-9b68-434c-8f35-d3db5d219af2 data-spacefinder-role=showcase data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-5h0uf4><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Another potentially new parasitic fungus on a harvestman spider.</span> Photograph: João Araújo</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>They believe they made more discoveries of fungal parasites on the trip, but need to do more checks. They include a parasitic fungus that preys on a harvestman spider, and another that attacks dung beetles.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“The new species that attacks trapdoor spiders belongs to a mega-diverse group of fungi,” said Araújo. “We know about 1% of its diversity, so we know very little. Foundational scientific work is needed so we can, perhaps, investigate new medical compounds or use them to protect against pests in crops.”</p><figure id=8e84f070-e11b-432d-b904-81d6b65f760f data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>‘Extraordinary’ sighting of orca with baby pilot whale astounds scientistsRead more</a></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Lead researcher, Dr Oscar Alejandro Pérez Escobar, and Dr Natalia Przelomska, who conducted in-the-field sequencing, said their work would back up the new species hypothesis and could be used to speed up the identification of other species in threatened ecosystems.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Przelomska said: “Here at Kew, we have access to big DNA sequencing machines and all sorts of ways to produce data. That is often so much harder in biodiverse countries.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“So what was really special about the field trip was that we could go and use some of the newest DNA sequencing technologies with the people working there.
