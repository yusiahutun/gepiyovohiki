These are able to each clear 250-300kg (550-660lbs) of ocean waste at a time. They can also move and deliver goods on water, as well as perform marine inspections – all with no emissions, as they rely on solar power. In addition, Clearbot has developed special modules: one can be deployed to clear aquatic plants that block waterways, while another can absorb and collect oil from the water’s surface.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The co-founders of Clearbot, Utkarsh Goel and Sidhant Gupta, established Open Ocean Engineering in 2020 while studying at the University of Hong Kong. It began as a project to help Indonesian surfers gather plastic from the sea, but when they tested the system in places such as Hong Kong and India, they soon realised the problem was greater than they had first imagined. Goel and Gupta knew they had to scale up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/23/925d34a3-2c44-4049-bd57-df3949b91aff_42abb50a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2021, Open Ocean Engineering entered the inaugural City I&T Grand Challenge in the Open Group (Environmental Sustainability), and won HK$800,000 (US$100,000) in co-creation funding by the government for prototyping. The company also received support from the Innovation and Technology Commission on training in market research, product design, patent rights, pitching and other essential skills.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The funding from City I&T Grand Challenge was critical in a unique way,” says Goel, who divides his time between India and Hong Kong. “The funding gave us the opportunity to not just produce a bot; it also helped us do market research. This was around the time when we were trying to understand the different use cases [of our design], and the fund helped us see what different marine services we could do with our bot.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We got to pilot it with an actual client, and using this funding, we deployed the boat ‘on the ground’,” Goel adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/23/a5e5482b-b82a-441d-9066-acf1391cf222_5a6519ea.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beyond winning funding, the most significant catalyst for Clearbot’s early growth, Goel says, was the guidance the company received to promote the viability of its product in the market. “That support and experience for us, very early in our company’s life, gave us the time to sit back and understand the design and engineering requirements better, where we could think about product design, prototype, manufacturing, and really build something out that goes to a client,” he adds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Clearbot has been able to increase its team from four to 20, and upgrade its fleet from having just one automated bot to 12 within the last year of growth. The start-up has gone on to partner with multinational tech companies such as Razer and Microsoft, engage in commercial projects with Sino Group and Bupa, and secure investments from the Alibaba Entrepreneur Fund and Gobi Partners Greater Bay Area, which have become springboards for financial support for Clearbot’s growth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As the team scales from 20 today to even 50 people, we now have the experience of knowing with whom to do market research and how to approach prototyping for new bots,” Goel says. “It enabled a grand vision where we see these bots going from 10 to a hundred to a thousand.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/23/fec5a48a-e324-4da7-b04b-a143e39520c6_ed5e492c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Goel hopes the exposure generated by competitions such as the City I&T Grand Challenge will bring sustainability-minded innovations to the fore. “In the beginning, our challenge was that we gave the impression of 23-year-olds who were really passionate about the environment and just doing it for charity,” Goel says. “But I hope we can set an example and show people that you can build innovative start-ups that also have a positive impact on the environment – to have a business that focuses on sustainability, but also makes money at the same time.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As the bots are empowered with AI, they are able to detect and analyse debris for information such as the product brand and – by tagging its geolocation – the waste material’s movements, eventually enabling Clearbot to trace the problem to its roots. “We’ve tried to find who’s producing these materials in the first place,” Goel says. “But, can we work with them to bring about the change to make things more sustainable? That would bring huge value to marine research, but we’ve not really got to that scale. I hope in the near future, that’s something we can do.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The City I&T Grand Challenge returns for its second edition, beginning this month, offering a chance for all sectors of the community to submit creative solutions and show how innovation and technology can help drive positive change in Hong Kong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/23/2af9e8f0-bba0-4d3c-abcc-c376ecb972e5_3967e615.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Launched in 2020, the Grand Challenge provides winners with funding and training to take intelligent solutions for the community and turn them into tangible reality. This year’s competition theme is “Hong Kong’s Got I&T”, aiming to showcase the best talents across all sectors in the city who are putting forward solutions that target two issues: “I&T for Nature” and “I&T for Community”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I&T for Nature looks for solutions which help improve the operation and management of country parks and campsites, and enhance hikers’ experiences in nature with the use of I&T. I&T for Community is about enhancing support for carers through the application of technology.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Entrants can take part in one of four groups – primary school, secondary school and university/tertiary institute, as well as an open group.</p>Submissions for this year’s City I&T Grand Challenge are being accepted until May 16, 2024.
