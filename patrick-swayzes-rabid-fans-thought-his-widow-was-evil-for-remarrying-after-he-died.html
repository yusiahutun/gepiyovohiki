However, she didn’t receive a great reaction from fans.</p><p>“Yes, I got a lot of flak — it’s like, ‘How dare you,'” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> on the Amy and T.J. podcast. “There are some pretty rabid Patrick fans out there who think I’m evil, just don’t like me because I was married to him.”</p><p>“So there was a lot of flak that came on that, a lot of criticism, and you just learn to deal with it and move on,” the 67-year-old continued.</p><p>“I was so tempted so many times to say, ‘Hey girlfriend, stand in my shoes, tell me about it. Go ahead, tell me just because I lost my husband that I don’t love him anymore.’”</p><p>The couple met three years after Swayze’s death, but says her relationship didn’t affect her love for the star ‘one bit’.</p><p>“Patrick is still with me. I still have a relationship with him,” she said. Although he’s “psychically not here,” Lisa said she still feels him there every day.</p><p>“I really fell in love with Albert, and … it was interesting to see how it didn’t affect my love for Patrick one bit.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-knew-he-was-a-dead-man-after-diagnosis>The star knew he was a ‘dead man’ after diagnosis</h2><p>In 2007, the <a href=#>movie</a> star’s cancer diagnosis shocked the world. He lived with the disease for under two years, and tragically passed away aged 57.</p><p>However, Lisa has now revealed the star ‘knew it was the end,’ soon after his diagnosis.</p><p>“When he first found out he had pancreatic cancer he turned to me and said, ‘I’m a dead man,'” Lisa told the podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>Although she didn’t know much about pancreatic cancer herself, she explains the actor did, and from what he knew “anytime you heard someone had had pancreatic cancer it was like, ‘Well, he’s out of here.'”</p><p>She then explained from then on, “every ounce of energy they had was gonna go into helping him live.”</p><p>However, she did recall one extremely heartbreaking moment when they were walking together at their New Mexico Ranch.</p><p>“We’re walking along. It’s a beautiful day, and he looked at me with tears in his eyes, he said, ‘I want to live.'”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2Z9cLzAramim5tiwLit2LOcrGWilq%2BqsIyfmKerXam1sMHGoatmoJmoeri1w6iuZq%2BRqHqmwsilZJ%2BnomK%2FprnAq6myoZ6ceqKy056pZqCVYrGqscNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
