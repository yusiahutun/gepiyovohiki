Sharing the adorable image, Paul wrote,</p><p style=text-align:justify>"I’m thinking it’s a sign, that the freckles in our eyes are mirror images and when we kiss they’re perfectly aligned... and I’d have to speculate that God himself do make us into corresponding shapes like puzzle pieces from the clay....

I don’t think people share much of the struggle, I know I don’t share too much of a struggle.&nbsp;But I wanted to share this last breakdown/challenge that Katie and I went through.

A beautiful caption indeed followed the post,</p><p style=text-align:justify>"I was once told that “love is not a relationship, that love is a commitment… To love… So if the relationship, Changes – the love can still remain.&nbsp;Nobody plans on getting divorced, or ending a long-term relationship… But when that happens you have a choice to honor one another, or destroy one another with behind the back talking...To friends or… The very worst to your children. Our commitment was to love each other till death do us part, and even though we’ve been separated and divorced for several years… We still love each other, and respect each other… And each other’s partners. Just Like what&nbsp;@angigreene&nbsp;and&nbsp;@gwynethpaltrow&nbsp;@drhabibsadeghi&nbsp;said about conscious uncoupling- replacing the nasty divorce and the desire to consciously raise the kiddos together.
