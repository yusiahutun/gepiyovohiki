It’s true! It’s right there in the bylaws, trust me. Don’t fret: The way I make latkes hasn’t changed. But this post was aggressively overdue for some fresh photos and a bit of crisping up, and just in time for Hanukkah.</p><p>Everyone makes latkes, fried potato pancakes that are the star of the traditional Ashkenazi Hanukkah celebration, a little differently. Some are more mashed and thick; some are in smaller bits and very flat. I love them all. But perhaps unsurprisingly, I still think mine are the very best: tangled in a knot, barely tethered with batter, and very crisp.</p><p><span id=more-1533></span><br><strong>Watch me make these latkes on YouTube!</strong></p><p style=text-align:center></p><span class=embed-youtube style=text-align:center;display:block></span><p><strong>Here are my unwavering latke principles:</strong></p><p>Russet or Idaho potatoes only: The best latkes are made with starchy baking potatoes, which give us textured edges and as much lightness as you can get from a knot of potatoes enrobed in batter and fried in oil. If you’re in the UK, my understanding is that Maris Pipers are the closest equivalent.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/53376638024_cb495fd842_z.jpg alt="latkes potato pancakes-01" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Coarsely grated: For warp speed and an appreciation of intact knuckles, I like to grate my potatoes in a food processor. My <a href=#>Cuisinart</a> model has an oval-shaped chute where I can lay potatoes on their side for the longest strands. A spiralizer also makes very charming mop-looking latkes.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/53376638049_08c685e40f_z.jpg alt="latkes potato pancakes-03" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Well-seasoned: Salt and pepper, please.</p><p>Potato starch and egg for binder: In addition to an egg, I prefer potato starch instead of flour as the binder in my latkes. I find the effect lighter, more crisp, and it leaves them naturally gluten-free. I can find it easily <a href=#>online</a> and my bag lasts a long time.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/53376316131_f467bf191a_z.jpg alt="latkes potato pancakes-07" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Latkes are best small: In my humble opinion, a latke should be one or two bites at most. I think of latkes as handheld food; larger ones are too messy. If you come from a line of fork-and-knife classy latke eaters, well, that’s lovely and keep it up. I’ll be over here, apathetically sloppy.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/53376638229_dc1bb032a1_z.jpg alt="latkes potato pancakes-05" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Do not skimp on the oil: My favorite oil for latkes is peanut oil, but if nut allergies are a concern, any high heat-friendly vegetable or sunflower oil will work. Check the label and if it’s not made clear that it’s good for frying, choose another type. I put a generous 1/4″ layer of oil in my pan. When a pan is heated properly, as I’ll walk you through below, the vast majority of the oil stays behind. I never need to add more between panfuls.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/53376638209_60d5a3f8cf_z.jpg alt="latkes potato pancakes-06" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Scale up as needed: I routinely 5x this recipe to use a whole 5-pound bag of potatoes for a party. For our annual Latke Vodka party, shamed by having run out in 40 minutes last year, I’m going for a full 10x to 15x.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/53376316326_6870087ec0_z.jpg alt="latkes potato pancakes-11" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Go ahead; make them in advance: Latkes reheat fantastically. I keep mine in the freezer if making them in advance, and reheat them on baking sheet at 375°F until they’re crisp all over again. My best advice: If you’re making them with the intention of freezing them for later, cook them for a minute less so the color is a touch lighter. This way when they re-toast in the oven, they won’t get too dark.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/53376316496_9555f1f8f4_z.jpg alt="latkes potato pancakes-14" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>All-season latkes: If you think that latkes are just for Hanukkah, with all due respect, you’re totally missing out. I have yet to see a better “bed” to rest your poached or fried egg upon, like a <a href=#>hash browns</a> for the holiday season. And the fact that latkes are so easy to make in advance and reheat/recrisp in the oven means that they can be an especially schedule-forgiving brunch dish. We also love them as a party food; ideally topped with crème fraîche and caviar to please the Russians in your life; more suggestions below for everyone else.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/53376316576_e1b9fe802e_z.jpg alt="latkes potato pancakes-18" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Things to serve on latkes:</strong><br>– Sour cream or crème fraîche<br>– <a href=#>Applesauce</a><br>– Caviar, if you’re fancy; lox works too<br>– Something pickled, like these <a href=#>Easiest Fridge Dill Pickles</a> or this milder <a href=#>Viennese Cucumber Salad</a>, or pickled red onion or shallots<br>– Something fun, like <a href=#>Smoked Whitefish Dip</a>, <a href=#>Chicken Liver Pâté</a>, <a href=#>Wild Mushroom Pâté</a>, or <a href=#>tzatziki</a>.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/53376761610_8ce34d5787_z.jpg alt="latkes potato pancakes-17" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Things to serve with latkes:</strong><br>– I feel that handheld latkes need handheld salads, too and highly recommend one or both of my favorite endive salads, the <a href=#>Endives with Oranges and Almonds</a> or <a href=#>Endive Salad with Toasted Breadcrumbs and Walnuts</a> (here I keep the breadcrumb mixture on the side in a bowl with a spoon and leave the endives as “boats” you can spoon it onto).<br>– A simple soup, like <a href=#>Balthazar’s Cream of Mushroom Soup</a> or <a href=#>Silky Cauliflower Soup</a><br>– And please don’t forget the <a href=#>New York Sour, aka Manichewitz Sour</a></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/53376316361_78c469f3d5_z.jpg alt="latkes potato pancakes-12" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>A Slice-and-Bake Cookie Palette</a><br><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>Parmesan Black Pepper Biscotti</a></p><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop=name>Potato Pancakes (Latkes)</h3><ul class=jetpack-recipe-meta><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop=recipeYield><strong>Servings: </strong>Makes 12 small pancakes</li><li class=jetpack-recipe-time><strong>Time:</strong> <span class=time>30 minutes</span></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-source><strong>Source: </strong>Smitten Kitchen</li><li class=jetpack-recipe-print><a href=#>Print</a></li></ul>Your yield will vary by the size of your latkes; I aim for small ones (about 2-ish inches across) and get about a dozen per batch.<ul><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 pound (about 1 large) Russet or Idaho (baking) potato, peeled</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 small (about 4 ounces) yellow onion, peeled</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/4 cup potato starch or all-purpose flour</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>A few grinds black pepper</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 large egg</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>Peanut or vegetable oil, for frying</li></ul><strong>Prepare latke batter:</strong> In a food processor or on the large holes of a box grater, coarsely shred the potato and onion. For longer strands, lay the potato sideways in the chute of your food processor. Transfer to a lint-free towel and wring out as much liquid as possible. Let stand for 2 minutes, then wring it out again.<p>Transfer wrung-out potato and onion shreds to a large bowl, and add potato starch, salt, and pepper and toss to coat strands. Add egg and mix until evenly coated.</p><p><strong>Fry your latkes:</strong> Place your empty skillet over medium heat and heat for 2 minutes. (Yes, really!) Increase the heat to medium-high and pour 1/4-inch of oil into the pan. Let it heat a full minute before adding your first latke.</p><p>[This process of heating the pan still dry, then heating the oil ensures a virtually nonstick experience, even in a stainless steel or cast-iron skillet.]</p><p>You can form your latkes in one of two ways: In packed tablespoons or, as I prefer, to use a fork to twirl some strands around it, as if it were <a href=#>spaghetti</a>. Transfer to the heated oil and carefully lower in the pan. Repeat with more pancakes, spacing them out. Flatten them slightly if you prefer a thinner latke. Cook the latkes until the undersides are browned, about 1 1/2 minutes; then carefully flip and cook until equally colored on the second side, about 1 minute.</p><p>Transfer latkes to paper towels to blot excess oil. Repeat with the remaining potato mixture.</p><p><strong>To keep latkes warm:</strong> Heat oven to 175°F and keep a large baking sheet inside. Cover it with foil for easier cleanup. As you fry the latkes, drain them briefly on towels and transfer to this tray in the oven.</p><p><strong>Do ahead:</strong> Latkes are a do-ahead-er’s dream. Cooked, they keep well in the fridge for a day or two, or in the freezer, well wrapped, for up to two weeks. Reheat them on a baking sheet — no need to defrost first — at 375°F until they’re crisp all over again. If you’re making them with the intention of freezing them for later, cook them for a minute less so the color is a touch lighter. This way when they re-toast in the oven, they won’t get too dark.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/53376638674_0903ec3413_z.jpg alt="latkes potato pancakes-16" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-1533 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-1533 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
