It’s been reported <a href=#>music</a> star Victoria and David Beckham, as well as actor George Clooney and his wife, are keeping their distance.</p><p>After Victoria and David attended the <a href=#>royals</a>‘ 2018 wedding, it is said the two couples grew apart. Insiders claim Meghan and Harry believed the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> was sharing “tidbits” about them to the press, but this was never proved. The Sussexes have never said this themselves, either. The four are apparently now on better terms, but it was “awkward” for a decent amount of time.</p><p>Meghan and Harry also apparently butted heads with <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actor George and his wife Amal. Despite the TV actress having a “tight-knit” relationship with the actor, things went south after she married into The Firm. The couple apparently “ditched” Harry and Meghan in favor of Harry’s dad, <a href=#>King Charles</a>, say sources. They made an appearance at a Prince’s Trust event in London earlier this year.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>King Charles’ sweet gestures with fans was ‘inspired by Princess Diana’, author says</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sussexes-not-invited-to-a-friend-s-wedding>Sussexes ‘not invited to a friend’s wedding’</h2><p>It comes as a longtime friend of Harry and his brother <a href=#>Prince William</a>, Hugh Grosvenor, is set to get married to his girlfriend next year. However, insiders have suggested <a href=#>Harry was snubbed of an invite in favor of the future king</a>. This is so that the pair’s feud doesn’t overshadow Grosvenor’s special day.</p><p>This in itself is quite awkward, as the billionaire is godfather to both William and Harry’s children.</p><p>He was named a godparent of William’s eldest, <a href=#>Prince George</a>, after he was born in 2013, and then became a godfather for the second time when Harry’s son, Archie, was born in 2019.</p><p>Tom Bower, a former BBC journalist, has said Prince Harry and Meghan’s snub from his childhood friend’s wedding <a href=#>will have left the 39-year-old feeling “wounded.”</a></p><p>“Not being invited – alongside the King, Queen, The Waleses, and the cream of Britain’s high society – to such a wedding underlines how much of an outcast Harry now is.</p><p>“The exclusion will also be hurtful for personal reasons. Grosvenor has been an old friend. As young men, the pair partied and shot together. The joint family bonds go deep.”</p><p>He added: “Grosvenor did not need to be told by William, ‘It’s him or us.’ Surely, that message was tacitly understood.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>King Charles ‘worried about being upstaged’ by Meghan and Harry, author claims</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2WDcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaYp5xdorKotMCnZKaZoqC5pr%2BMsJydnJmjtG6%2Fza6ZZqGjo8FuwMeeZJ%2BhoqjBbsDIppxmrJiaxrexjKGYnWWWp7amusOsn6KoXajBs8HGoKOeq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
