The monarch will visit the south east London Royal Artillery Barracks on 31 May, in a move that will no doubt mean a great deal to the town's shocked community.On Friday, William was acting in his role as president of the Football Association as he made an opening speech to officials. The Prince, an Aston Villa fan, said his money was on Bayern Munich to win the all German Champions League final against Borussia Dortmund.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e4bc0eb3304c-prince-william1-z.jpg><p id=e6ucNI6NGwC5 data-wc=95>"It's a great honour for us, the English FA, to host not just this prestigious Congress, but of course — the real excitement — tomorrow's Champions League final," he said. "My money is on Bayern Munich and two-nil. "To host these events during our 150th anniversary is truly special. The rules of association football were drafted 150 years ago in a London pub very close to where we meet today. As you know, we English have a love affair with both football and our pubs, so it's no surprise that one helped create the other."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfp7y6rcutsGhqYGaAcYGRbWhrb2RtfLG%2ByKeanmWnnrmttcCmZK6dlpZ6psLEp6to</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
