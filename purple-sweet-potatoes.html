Like other produce, they come in all different shapes, flavors and colors. But one variety deserves some extra praise: purple sweet potatoes. These unique spuds may look unassuming but have a vibrant purple flesh on the inside. And their royal coloring doesn’t just make for a pretty plate — it also packs a ton of health benefits. Plus, they’re easy to cook and add delicious sweetness to any dish. If you’ve never tried purple sweet potatoes before, they’re sure to become a new favorite. Here’s what to know about the benefits of this nutritious vegetable and some easy recipe ideas.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are purple sweet potatoes?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/purple-sweet-potatoes.jpg><p>To start, there’s nothing artificial about ’em. Purple sweet potatoes are rich in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anthocyanin</a>, one of three naturally occurring phytochemicals that give vegetables their bright color. Anthocyanin is the source for blue, red and purple produce. You might be surprised to learn there are two main types of purple sweet potato, and they each have their own history:</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Stokes Purple</h3><p>Born in Stokes County, North Carolina, this sweet potato was first cultivated by sweet potato farmer Mike Sizemore, who later obtained a patent in 2006 to sell commercially. Now, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stokes Purple</a> sweet potatoes are grown in California and available most of the year. Both their skin and flesh is purple, and they have a mildly sweet, floral taste with a moderate starchy texture.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Okinawan</h3><p>Believed to originate in South America, explorers introduced this sweet potato to the Philippines and China before first being planted in Okinawa, Japan in the 1600s. Eventually, they made their way to Hawaii, where they now grow and are part of native cuisine. They have white skin with purple flesh, a mildly sweet flavor and a dry, starchy texture.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are they good for you?</h2><p>The best part about purple sweet potatoes? They offer a variety of health benefits. Purple potatoes are “high in fiber, which has been shown to make you feel full, reduce risk of certain types of cancer (colon cancer), and weight loss,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Saari, MSc, RD,</a> a registered dietician at E-Health Project. And don’t forget about anthocyanin. Saari says that this phytochemical “is known for being a cancer-fighting property, heart health, regulates blood sugars, and protects against age-related cognitive decline. They also provide essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, potassium and iron.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">George Yang</a>, founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yanre Fitness</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">OxygenArk</a>, echoes these sentiments. Our bodies absorb anthocyanin as antioxidants, which additionally “are recognized for reducing inflammation.” He adds that “incorporating purple sweet potatoes into your diet not only adds color to your meals but also boosts your nutritional intake with their unique health benefits.”</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>A Potato That Helps Optimize Blood Sugar? Yep! It’s a Beautiful Shade of Blue</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How they differ from other sweet potatoes</h2><p>So, what makes the purple sweet potato unique? It all comes down to their nutritional breakdown. While all sweet potatoes are healthy, different varieties provide different health benefits. <a href=#>Orange sweet potatoes</a>, for example, are higher in beta-carotene, another phytochemical that supports skin and eye health. Apart from higher anthocyanin, purple sweet potatoes are also starchier, drier and slightly less sweet than their counterparts.</p><p>It’s worth noting that purple sweet potatoes are different than purple yams. Though their insides are both purple, purple yams are native to Southeast Asia. The buzzy term “Ube” (pronounced oo-bay) is Tagalog, the national language of the Philippines, for purple yam. Purple yams have a rough, bark-like skin and are moist in texture.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to use purple sweet potatoes</h2><p>Stokes Purple sweet potatoes are usually available from late August through late spring, making them a great addition to fall and winter menus. Okinawan sweet potatoes are available year-round. You may find purple sweet potatoes in your nearest grocery store; however, they are also sold at farmers’ markets or specialty markets like Asian grocery stores.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>What to Look for When Buying Sweet Potatoes</a></p><p>Because of their dry, starchier texture, it’s best to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cook purple sweet potatoes longer</a> than you would other sweet potatoes. To maximize flavor and moistness, aim for 90 minutes at 350 degrees if using an oven. And yes, you can eat the skin! “Purple sweet potatoes are incredibly versatile,” says Saari.</p><p>If you’re looking for a simple preparation, she suggests “roasting them in the oven [to] bring out their natural sweetness. Cut them into cubes, toss with a little olive oil and your favorite herbs, and roast until tender. They also make a visually stunning addition to salads and grain bowls.”</p><p>Purple sweet potatoes can be stored just like other potatoes, but they have a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shorter lifespan</a> (1-2 weeks in a cool, dry place).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2 delicious purple sweet potato recipes</h2><p>Purple sweet potatoes are surprisingly easy use in many dishes featuring sweet potatoes.
