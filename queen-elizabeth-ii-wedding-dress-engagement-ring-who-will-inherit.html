He designed it using diamonds that were handed down from his mother, and it featured a brilliant-cut stone flanked by smaller pavé diamonds. It was nestled next to her Welsh gold wedding band, on which Philip reportedly&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>engraved a secret message</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0d956aef36ce-queen-dress-display-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ecAdep2bub2G data-wc=13><strong>The monarch's&nbsp;dress went on display in 2007 for her diamond wedding anniversary</strong></p><p id=e7OhjFQnEg7P data-wc=69>Should Queen Elizabeth II leave her bridal gown or her engagement and wedding rings to her family, they would likely be handed down to one of her great-grandchildren who have not yet married.

Zara Tindall opted to host her wedding reception with Mike Tindall at Her Majesty's official Scottish residence, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, and wore an ivory silk dress designed by Stewart Parvin, one of her grandmother's favourite couturiers.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKXTrahMCdHn data-wc=65>Meanwhile, Princess Beatrice wore a vintage wedding dress by Norman Hartnell,&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>on loan from the Queen</a>, when she married Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in 2021. She customised the frock with organza sleeves, with the help of Her Majesty's dresser Angela Kelly and loyal dressmaker Stewart Parvin, and added the Queen Mary diamond fringe tiara, which was the exact one worn by the Queen and Princess Anne on their wedding days.</p><p id=eYgyVmvZdHGr data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a aria-label="The Queen's closest friends and family to have private final moment away from cameras" class=hm-link href=#>The Queen's closest friends and family to have private final moment away from cameras</a></strong></p><p id=ejjRjrabNG-z data-wc=25><strong>Planning your wedding?
