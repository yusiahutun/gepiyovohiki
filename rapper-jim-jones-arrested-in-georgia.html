Wood says when he pulled close to the vehicle, he noticed the vehicle appeared to be full of smoke that smelled like cannabis, the Times-Herald said.</p><p>Deputies then attempted to stop the Mercedes, which they say initially pulled over before trying to speed away, leading deputies on a short chase that was finally ended when Investigator Wood intentionally rammed the Mercedes, Sheriff James Yarborough told the newspaper.</p><p>Investigators allege that while conducting a search of the vehicle, they found a backpack that contained 23 Oxycodone pills and a loaded Titan .25 caliber pistol. They also reported finding marijuana scattered around the interior of the vehicle, as well as a Ruger SR 9mm handgun reported stolen from Dekalb County in March. In the back of the SUV, another backpack was located that reportedly contained a variety of Oxycodone, Percocet and THC oil, the Times-Herald said.</p><p>According to the newspaper, Jones conceded that he had smoked marijuana but denied being aware of the firearms and stated that he had a prescription for the prescription drugs but did not have it on him at the time.</p><p>All four occupants of the vehicle were arrested and transported to a local medical facility for evaluation before being booked into Coweta County Jail early Thursday morning.</p><p>The four individuals are currently awaiting an arraignment hearing where a bond amount will be determined.</p><p>Jones is best known as one of the founding members of the New York-based hip-hop collective The Diplomats. More recently, he’s pursued a solo career, and in April, released his sixth studio “Wasted Talent” album via Vamplife and EMPIRE Distribution.</p><p>Jones is slated to perform at a reunion of The Diplomats at the Regent in Los Angeles on July 15th.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZoVwfJVoaWpnopa9sbHRZqGipV2fvK%2Bx0maYq6qVqMGmsIyipWaflaS%2FqLXAaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
