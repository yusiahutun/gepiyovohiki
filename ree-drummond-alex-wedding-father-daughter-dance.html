Alex's dad, Ladd Drummond, made it to the wedding, just a month afterbreaking his neck in two places during a head-on collision near the Pioneer Woman Ranch. The family patriarch was even able to take his neck brace off to walk his oldest child down the aisle and for the traditional father-daughter dance."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The family patriarch was even able to take his neck brace off to walk his oldest child down the aisle and for the traditional <a href=#>father-daughter dance.</a> That's the part that's gonna make fans misty.</p><p>For the dance, the bride&nbsp;had her band play "Cowgirls Don't Cry," a Top 5 single for Brooks & Dunn in 2008 that was later released as a collaboration with <a href=#>Reba McEntire</a>. The lyrics describe a father-daughter relationship all the way to its end. Spoiler alert: the dad dies in the song — Alex, why ya gotta do us like that!?</p><p>"Cowgirls don't cry / Ride, baby, ride / Lessons in life are going to show you in time / Soon enough you're gonna know why / It's gonna hurt every now and then / If you fall get back on again / Cowgirls don't cry," the duo sings.</p><p>"It’s a country song that we always listen to, it's about a girl who grew up in the country, and I just feel like it was very fitting for my relationship with my dad," Alex says, courtesy of the <a href=#>Pioneer Woman website</a>.</p><p>That wasn't the only country music moment at the wedding: Scott also danced to a country song for his mother-son dance. She wanted "Through the Years" by <a href=#>Kenny Rogers </a>because&nbsp;of the lyrics. The rest of the night may have been a mix of music and emotions, but those two sentimental dances will certainly be remembered best the couple and their respective parents.</p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>19 Country Music Stars With a Lot of Kids</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmq52VYrGzwcympqecXZa5psSMsJydnJmjtG6ywK2fnqpdma62s8etnKtllJa7pLGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
