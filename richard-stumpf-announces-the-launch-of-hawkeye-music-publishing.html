They are a group that fully embrace innovation and provide expertise across several sectors of a constantly evolving and overlapping music space. I’m humbled and excited by their participation,” said Richard Stumpf.</p><p>“What was clear to me working alongside tech and catalog companies was that there is an enormous and growing appetite for copyrights – both from a consumer and ownership perspective,” Stumpf continued. “I wanted to put myself in a position where I could bring relationship driven catalog business to a home where I knew the music would be treated with the utmost respect and at the same time have a partner who could assist in administering Hawkeye, which would be dedicated to active writers. I found that strategic partner in Round Hill Music. Josh and his team exemplify what it means to be a proactive partner who puts the music and writers first.”</p><p>“Rich is a real music guy with a lot of creative ideas about maximizing value for copyrights and writers. He’s a respected industry vet that I’m happy to have working alongside Round Hill Music. We’ve already been able to welcome Warren Haynes as a Round Hill Music client and are grateful to Rich for the introduction and endorsement,” added Round Hill’s Josh Gruss.</p><p>With a reputation in the music publishing world, Stumpf played a key role in the growth of busineesses Cherry Lane, Imagem and most recently Atlas, which he sold to Scooter Braun’s Ithaca Holdings in 2019. With an eye for talent, Stumpf helped to discover and sign artists such as John Legend, The Black Eyed Peas, Toby Gad, Wolfmother, and Saint PHNX and helped to launch the first-ever video game publishing JV with Electronic Arts.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4FwfJNoaW1nop6wqa3RnWSsrKWivad5wKelqK2emLK0edOhnGakkaq7pLSMqJ1moJGsuKbFxGakrquZmHqxwcGloKygmaO0cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
