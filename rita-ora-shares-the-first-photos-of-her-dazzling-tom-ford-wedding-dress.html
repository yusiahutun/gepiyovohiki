To get married in his dress was a dream come true. And because it wasn’t planned, I didn’t know if the right dress was even going to be in town, and I just took the risk and went to the Tom Ford shop, and they had it perfectly waiting with the veil, in my size, no alterations needed to be done. I mean, it was like it was meant to be, to be honest. And it just made me so happy.”</p><p id=ezs2RsA88M-I data-wc=75>The couple's decision to exchange vows at their LA residence was a testament to their desire for a personal and intimate ceremony. However, the pair's star-studded guest list featured family, with Taika explaining “My daughters were there, and they made everything really fun and easy: I think just because we didn’t have the pressure of having caterers and all of these things, you know, people turning up late, and all of the different moving parts.”</p><p id=eowjzuqy_1 data-wc=12><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Lace and visible lingerie is Rita Ora’s new awards season uniform</a></strong></p><p id=eEwhXqylROe data-wc=15><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Rita Ora just had a surprise hen do and you might have missed it</a></strong></p><p id=e6DHFpsEYQXa data-wc=76>Tom Ford, one of the most influential fashion designers of our time, is renowned for his impeccable style and exquisite craftsmanship.
