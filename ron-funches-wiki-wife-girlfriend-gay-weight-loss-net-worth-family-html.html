He made a huge announcement when he appeared on the TV program 'Late Late Show With James Corden.'</p><p>Ron lovingly calls his wife 'Robot' because she only had one wallpaper in the dating app, which made him believe that she wasn't real.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Failed Married Life With First Wife</h2><p>Ron was previously married to a wife whose identity remains a mystery. Though there is no information about his ex-wife, we have come to know that he lived for many years in Salem with his estranged wife.</p><p>Nevertheless, the couple is parents to their son Malcolm Funches.&nbsp;The former couple once faced great pain as their son was diagnosed with autism needing special care.</p><p><img alt height=333 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikinetworth.com/uploads/Ron%20son.JPG width=400 ezimgfmt="rs rscb2 src ng ngcb2" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ron with his son Malcolm (Photo: sporkful.com)</p><p>As Ron used to be busy with his work, he could not give much time to his family, so&nbsp;he got separated from his wife in 2012. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Why Gay Speculations?</h2><p>Although&nbsp;Ron is a married man with a wife, there were speculations of him being gay because of his humorous personality.&nbsp;</p><p>While he was on sets, he would share smooches with his male co-actors behind the camera, which gave rise to speculations of him being gay. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>For instance, we saw him kiss&nbsp;Michael Ian Black on the set of 'The Meltdown.'&nbsp;Then in 2015, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> a kiss with Undatebale's co-star Rick Glass for a video.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187></span><p>Such actions caught him under gay rumors, but that's not true. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Ron's Profesional Journey</h2><p>Ron got interested in comedy right from his childhood. In his early days, humor used to be his weapon to save himself and his sister from his mother's scolding. Whenever his mother laughed at his jokes, he used to think that he was good at making people laugh.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-710 data-method=ai-placeholders class=ezoic-autoinsert-ad></span><p>However, he was not a full-time comedian at the prior stage of his career. He was engaged in different jobs before giving his full time for comedy. At first, he did his job at a bank call center. He also worked for Liberty Tax Services as a Lady Liberty, dancing around with a sign, which also helped him pave the way for a comedy career.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-native_bottom"></span><p>His career as a full-time comedian got started at the age of 23 in Portland, Oregon. In 2012, he moved to Los Angeles from Portland to make a career in comedy. One of his first acting credits is an episode of 'Portlandia' (2011).</p><p>Ron has&nbsp;written many episodes of Comedy Central's 'Kroll Show' and even 'The Eric Andre Show,' 'Funny or Die's Night Night.' He is also a roundtable guest on 'Chelsea Lately.' In November 2015, Ron released his debut album 'The Funches of Us' and had also made his appearance on '@midnight' several times. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During the pandemic, he came up&nbsp;with a new game show named Nice One!&nbsp;premiered on August 24 (2020) on Quibi.</p><h2>His Net Worth</h2><p>Ron has successfully established himself as a famous American comedian, actor, and writer. He has received a significant salary from his profession, which helped&nbsp;him accumulate a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> of $500 thousand.</p><h2>His Short Wiki: Bio</h2><p>Ron was born on March 12, 1983, in Gardena, CA, possessing&nbsp;black ethnicity.
