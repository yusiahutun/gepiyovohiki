A woman named Brittany Hogan was there, too, and as her friends headed to the larger stage to see a bigger act, she stuck around to watch Ellis perform.</p><p>"I'm not usually the guy that spots the girl in the crowd or whatever," Ellis tells <a href=#>The Boot</a>, but a direct message on social media from Brittany sparked their relationship.</p><p>"I've gotten to hear her love of music on [the fan] side, and it's been incredible," Ellis reflects, later adding, "So as much as I gripe about all of the social media stuff and it taking up time, that's where [our relationship] came from."</p><p>Brittany lives in Portland, Ore., but despite her distance from Nashville and Ellis' (in non-pandemic times) busy work schedule, the couple has been able to spend quite a bit of time together. It's going well, Ellis says, to the point that he wrote her a song while she was in Nashville one weekend.</p><p>"Love Blind," Ellis' latest release, was co-written with Allison Veltz and Zach Kale.&nbsp;It's a reflection of where Ellis is at now, but also a prayer: "Tell all your angels to work overtime /&nbsp;Stay on both shoulders and keep me in line /&nbsp;You walked on water and turned it to wine /&nbsp;So, Lord, make me better and keep her love blind," he sings in the chorus.</p><p>"[Brittany]&nbsp;got to come in [and hear it] at the end of the song, while I was singing the [demo] vocal on it," Ellis shares — nothing like some instantaneous feedback on a heartfelt song to test a new-ish relationship, right?</p><p>"In my mind, I was like, 'I hope she likes it,'" he admits with a chuckle.</p><p>Ellis is fairly hard on himself in "Love Blind," especially in the first verse: "If she could see all the bottles I drank every night before I met her /&nbsp;Bet we woulda never made it to all the pictures and love letters," he sings.</p><p>"You've gotta have some self-awareness," Ellis says, explaining, "I've had my wild spells, and still do from time to time" — especially when he first came to Music City.</p><p>"You move to Nashville, this crazy city, and don't know a soul — of course you're going to go out and party," he continues. "I've lived, and that's my story."</p><p>During the novel coronavirus pandemic, in between golf games and visits with Brittany, Ellis has been songwriting, bringing collaborators in remotely.&nbsp;<span>For about two months, he spent time each day sharing unreleased songs via social media; the daily performances were a good way to get fans' takes on Ellis' back catalog of songs as he works on a larger collection of music.</span></p><p>"Kinda messed up my golf swing, but ...," Ellis jokes.</p><p><strong>See Country Music's Best Love Stories:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmq6ejqHqmuMuiqmakn6uybq7LoqWdZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
