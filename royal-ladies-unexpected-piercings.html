She surprised royal fans when she stepped out for her first engagement of the year this week, appearing to debut a new second ear piercing. The 49-year-old royal sported a subtle silver stud in her left ear when she attended the traditional Pascua Militar celebration alongside husband&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>King Felipe VI</a>. Letizia showed off her new piercing by sweeping her brunette hair up into a bun and wore an elegant pair of silver hoops.</p><p id=eBOKXOmcM8tw data-wc=12><strong>GALLERY: <a class=hm-link href=#>Royals wearing tiaras for the first time - 12 glittering photos</a></strong></p><h2><span>Duchess of Sussex</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4796712d3e3a-piercing-1-z.jpg><p id=eCez4wz6uPc7 data-wc=54>The <a class=hm-link href=#>Duchess of Sussex</a> is also fond of cuff-style earrings, having worn them on a number of occasions – though she is actually thought to only have one piercing in each ear. Her mother, <a class=hm-link href=#>Doria Ragland</a>, notably sports a delicate nose stud, which she proudly wore to her daughter's <a class=hm-link href=#>royal wedding</a> in May 2018.</p><h2>Lady Marina Windsor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4ba2f0123982-piercing-2-z.jpg><p id=ee2-eHlxHM60 data-wc=45>Lady Marina Windsor sparked controversy when she arrived at the Queen's annual pre-Christmas lunch in December 2012 sporting a tragus piercing.

Stories at the time claimed that her mother, <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Anne</a>, was unfazed by her new look, and simply asked if she was able to speak properly. Zara was also thought to have a belly button piercing during her younger years.</p><h2>Princess Sofia of Sweden</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b07dbf07f74b-piercing-5-z.jpg><p id=ei3JaJiOSBteh data-wc=46><a class=hm-link href=#>Sofia Hellqvist</a>, now Princess Sofia of Sweden, made headlines in 2010 when she was confirmed as the new girlfriend of <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Carl Philip of Sweden</a>.
