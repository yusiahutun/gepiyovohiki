Throughout the years, she’s been married twice and also had a long-term relationship with <a href=#>Burt Reynolds</a>.</p><p>The <a href=#>Mrs. Doubtfire</a>&nbsp;actress exchanged vows with her first husband, <strong>Steven Craig</strong>, in 1968. The couple became the proud parents of their sons, <strong>Peter Craig</strong> and <strong>Eli Craig</strong>, but they sadly split after seven years of marriage in 1975.</p><p>Two years after ending things with her first husband, the A-lister and her&nbsp;<a href=#>Smokey and the Bandit</a> costar, Burt, started dating. Though it was rocky at times, their iconic relationship lasted for five years before they called it quits in 1982.</p><p>“<a href=#>He was an important part of my life</a> for a very long period of time,” Sally gushed during a press appearance for her <a href=#>memoir In Pieces</a> in December 2018, which came just three months after <a href=#>Burt’s death</a> in September. “He was a catalyst for me in a lot of ways, and I probably was for him.”</p><p>Following her split from Burt, Sally walked down the aisle again for a second time in 1984, this time with <strong>Alan Greisman</strong>. The Flying Nun alum and the Hollywood film producer expanded the movie icon’s family when they welcomed her youngest son, <strong>Sam Greisman</strong>, in 1987. However, the former pair divorced in 1994.</p><p>It’s been years since the Academy Award winner was in a relationship, but Sally isn’t stressed about being single. “<a href=#>I’m really happy</a> with how I am, and I really don’t want to pick up your underwear in the morning, you know?” she jokingly dished during her book event.</p><p>Aside from focusing on her iconic showbiz career, Sally also keeps herself occupied with her children. “The three things <a href=#>I’m most proud of in my life are my sons</a>,” she gushed to Closer Weekly in February 2020. “They are kind, loving, productive people. Each with their own list of talents and accomplishments.”</p><p>These days, Sally also adores being a doting grandma to her <a href=#>five grandkids</a>, Isabel, Sophie, Ogden, Noah and Colin. “She loves having so many grandchildren,” an insider told Closer. “She’s fun and goofy with them.”</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to learn more about Sally’s relationships!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46smKWkqWKzqrHLnWShraOXrq%2Bw0maYnKyimsC0ecyaqauhlZl6tcPInJxmmZ6ZeqWt056bZpqlp8FuvsSypaiklKh8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
