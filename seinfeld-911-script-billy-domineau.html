Jerry becomes obsessed with the “dust” that now coats his city, George is happy to be mistaken for a hero who pulled people from the wreckage, Elaine must keep dating a guy who was in one of the Twin Towers, while Kramer seeks restitution for his box cutter, which he had “lent” to his friend Mo Atta.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>More than any other show, Seinfeld inspires current takes on the series.

These days, the team improvises a <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">new episode regularly</a>.</p><figure id=73651979-9efd-4747-b352-00eace29e2de data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.VideoYoutubeBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl></figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>Even the show’s jazzy theme song has been given <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">an EDM spin</a>. Part of the reason for the proliferation of present-day Seinfeld takes is, of course, the show’s incredible popularity, as both a critical darling (<a href=# data-link-name="in body link">it won 10 Emmys and was nominated for 68</a>) and as a ratings bonanza for NBC. In syndication it broadcasts in nearly every market in the US, nearly 20 years after going off the air.</p><figure id=3cbb1106-bb97-4e04-a6d0-e652bf6cec8e data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>How Seinfeld's funniest moments came to lifeRead more</a></figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>But really what makes it so fun to reference and mimic is the fundamental simplicity of the series. The show’s famous “No hugging, no learning” policy meant that the characters didn’t evolve in the same way that other sitcom characters do; they eagerly spun in their own hamster wheels. The four leads had their distinctive, self-absorbed perspectives – Jerry was bemused, George was neurotic, Elaine was incensed, Kramer was kooky – and they could be cleanly placed in a multitude of unlikely scenarios.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The concept of characters making a mountain out of a molehill would continue with Seinfeld co-creator Larry David’s next venture, Curb Your Enthusiasm. But that show – looser, more improvised – is less fun to adapt than the tightly scripted Seinfeld, which fell neatly into traditional three-act structure. (Watch a classic episode with all the jokes edited out to see how clear its plot lines were; <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">the whole thing lasts only three minutes</a>.)</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Building on a beloved series is a simple way for a writer to present ideas in a recognizable format, and being outrageous is a smart way to attract attention, even if the script is impossible to produce. So two decades after it aired its finale, we’re likely to continue seeing takes on Seinfeld for years to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaKymYq6vsIyrmJ2hn2R%2FcX2VaJiun19lgnC%2FxKKln52cmXp6fZBmqpyqmaXBbq7IpaOyZZSkuqq6xJqs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
