While she misses her teenage-toned body, Selena has also acknowledged the things life has thrown at her. She posted a decade-old picture in a zebra bikini and wrote “Today I realised I will never look like this again…”. She also posted a picture from her 2023, Cabo San Lucas, Mexico holiday last year, showing how she has changed and transformed. The Calm Down singer was seen flaunting a high-waisted bikini bottom and a well-crafted bikini top, all in White.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>The singer had been a victim of body shaming after undergoing treatment for her lupus diagnosis. It’s been seven years since she was diagnosed with lupus and losing the teenage toned body has only made the Back to You singer self-conscious. She has often spoken to news outlets stating, “None of the sample sizes were fitting, and that would make me feel embarrassed. Although how unrealistic is it to expect a normal woman’s body not to change?” This had happened when she went for a magazine fitting. But seeing her confidence has made fans' hearts full. She captioned the second image, “I’m not perfect, but I am proud to be who I am… Sometimes I forget it’s ok to be me.”&nbsp;</p><h2 id=65b0054abcb55><strong>Did body image issues affect Selena Gomez?</strong></h2><p><img alt="Selena Gomez (Via Instagram)" title="Selena Gomez (Via Instagram)" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-01/1706029720_image-500x500-1-1.jpg></p><p><a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Selena Gomez Shows Her Two Body Positive Sides In Throwback Bikini PICS, Says ‘Proud To Be Who I Am&#39; ","1273515","https://www.pinkvilla.com/trending/world/what-selena-gomez-plans-to-do-after-releasing-her-last-album-singer-gives-update-1269132","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/selena-gomez-shows-her-two-body-positive-sides-in-throwback-bikini-pics-says-proud-to-be-who-i-am-1273515","After the Taki Taki singer was","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","hollywood")'>After the Taki Taki singer was</a> diagnosed with lupus, she had to undergo chemotherapy and kidney transplant. Post recovery she went to Australia to unwind where her bikini shots were taken by Papparazis and these photos with her scars grabbed headlines instantly. It soon became a personal battle, and the situation got worse as she was recovering from a controversial separation from ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber. The scrutiny over her body image issues on social media added more trouble to her life and Selena often felt depressed. The Fetish singer was up against another battle in 2018 when the Lose You to Love Me singer found out she has Bipolar disorder. This tormented feeling made her want to cancel commitments, but she kept her hope high and came out stronger as a woman.</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","Selena Gomez Shows Her Two Body Positive Sides In Throwback Bikini PICS, Says ‘Proud To Be Who I Am&#39; ",1273515,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/selena-gomez-confesses-shes-finally-attracted-to-the-right-kind-of-people-exploring-her-new-relationship-with-benny-blanco-1267033","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/selena-gomez-shows-her-two-body-positive-sides-in-throwback-bikini-pics-says-proud-to-be-who-i-am-1273515","Content Also read","entertainment","hollywood"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Selena Gomez Shows Her Two Body Positive Sides In Throwback Bikini PICS, Says ‘Proud To Be Who I Am&#39; ",1273515,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/selena-gomez-confesses-shes-finally-attracted-to-the-right-kind-of-people-exploring-her-new-relationship-with-benny-blanco-1267033","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/selena-gomez-shows-her-two-body-positive-sides-in-throwback-bikini-pics-says-proud-to-be-who-i-am-1273515","Selena Gomez confesses she’s finally ‘attracted to the right kind of people’: Exploring her new relationship with Benny Blanco ","Also_Read","entertainment","hollywood")'><strong>Selena Gomez confesses she’s finally ‘attracted to the right kind of people’: Exploring her new relationship with Benny Blanco</strong></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX528rbjYsKaonF%2Bosq2xzZpkoKedmsduv8eorqxlmJq%2FbsDWqGSbp5SuerG70qKroq6VYsCqsMSsZKKmXam1s7vWm5ico12Xtqy1zaJkqaGTqHq0rdisZKmqn6qxbsDOZpmeZaedvG61jJqkZmlibIB2fZQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
