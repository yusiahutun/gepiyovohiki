She’s now addressing claims she was ‘forced’ to donate her kidney, as the friendship seems like it’s well and truly back on track.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-883390870-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-francia-raisa-says-there-s-no-beef-between-her-and-selena>Francia Raísa says ‘there’s no beef’ between her and Selena</h2><p>Six years after the donation, Francia has now shut down claims that she was ‘forced’ to donate her kidney to the <a href=#>music</a> star, as she explained:</p><p>“I’ve said this before, but that was a time when I just felt it in my heart. No one forced me to do anything.”</p><p>“It came out of the genuine kindness of my heart, and I’ve been super blessed ever since.” She then said there was “no beef” between herself and the Calm Down singer, and joked instead, “There’s salsa”.</p><p>She then admitted that she “never in her life” pictured that a kidney donation would create such a stir. Speaking on the publicity she said:</p><p>“She and I both went public with our situation years ago and honestly, we had to. The press got a hold of the story and we wanted to tell it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The pair’s friendship explored</h2><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> pair met in 2007, 10 years before Francia donated her kidney to Gomez after her health took a decline. The besties even got matching tattoos to commemorate the moment.</p><p>However, things didn’t stay that way for long, as things started to go south when Selena called Taylor Swift her “only friend in the industry”, as Francia responded by writing “interesting” on Instagram before unfollowing her.</p><p>This March, however, in her Disney + documentary, the Wizards of Waverley Place alum called Raisa her “best friend” and after posting a birthday tribute, it seems like the alleged ‘feud’ is now well and truly over.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Selena calls Francia a ‘special human being’</h2><p>Taking to her 427 million <a href=#>Instagram</a> followers last week, Selena single-handedly shut down those ‘feud’ rumors for good as she honored her friend with a <a href=#>sweet birthday post</a>.</p><p>In the caption, she wrote: “Happiest of birthdays to this special human being. No matter where life takes us, I love you.”</p><p>After the post, the actress followed Gomez back on Insta, and now it seems like the case can be fully closed.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2WAcL%2FEpZynmV2cvK6x2axkn6qZmruledStq56qo2LBqb7EnmSwp6KZwG67zWaprqWfp8Buv8eeZLCZo2KzsL7CnptmrJ9isbC6wK2cZqOZmbumxY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
