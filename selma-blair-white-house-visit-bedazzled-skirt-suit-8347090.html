According to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, Biden was a major player in passing both those acts during his time in the Senate. Jean-Pierre explained that "he believed then, just as he believes now, that the federal government owes dignity and respect to every American, especially those with disabilities."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During her appearance on the South Lawn, Blair called herself “a proud disabled woman" and commended the White House for its continued protections for disabled Americans, saying, “The push towards equity continues. Our laws and policies must reflect that our disabled lives are not of lesser value.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the occasion, she wore a white skirt suit covered in crystal embellishments. As for her now-signature&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>walking stick</a>, she held a fully clear version and had her service dog, Scout, along for the visit. According to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>People</a>, Scout had a quick nap at President Biden's feet while Blair addressed attendees. Blair was&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>diagnosed with multiple sclerosis</a>&nbsp;back in 2018.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Biden also spoke about the historic legislation, saying that the landmark Americans With Disabilities Act was a "bipartisan bill, signed into law by a Republican president, George H.W. Bush, 33 years ago on this spot on the South Lawn of the White House."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It marked progress that wasn’t political but personal for millions of disabled American veterans and families," he added. "Folks, for more than 61 million Americans living with disability, these laws are a source of opportunity, meaningful inclusion, participation, respect, and, as my dad would say, the most important of all, dignity. Being treated with dignity."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The bill, which was signed into law back in 1990, prohibits discrimination based on disability. It also requires that all employers and public facilities provide reasonable accommodations to anyone with disabilities.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570p6jppldl7mitdFmrqGhpJp6qbvUrJxmrpmotrV5wZ6bmrKqobKledKkoKusXajCqsCMcWptb2BufQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
