Where are we headed?” it’s definitely too early to be meeting families. “It’s important that a relationship feel secure to both people before they meet each other’s parents,”&nbsp;says <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>Antonia Hall</a></strong>, a psychologist, relationship expert and author of the&nbsp;Sexy Little Guide&nbsp;books. “If you’re uncertain about where things are headed, adding parental introductions is only going to add pressure to the still blossoming relationship.”</p><h2><strong>You Can’t Answer Questions About the Relationship</strong></h2><p>Do you know their birthday? Their favorite food? Do you know enough about each other that there will be no surprises when parents ask? Take a moment to picture yourselves in that situation, suggests&nbsp;<strong>Julie Amann</strong>, a&nbsp;professional matchmaker with <a href=# rel=nofollow>It’s Just Lunch</a> in Madison, WI. “If you have no idea what you’ll say to his or her family when they start firing questions at you—it’s too soon.” Sitting at the dinner table with his/her mother and explaining that you barely know anything about them can be pretty awkward.</p><h2><strong>You Haven’t Met Each Other’s Friends</strong></h2><p>Introduction to friends is a better way to test the waters of compatibility than to launch into meeting the family, says Hall. “Knowing that you have your partner’s friends’ approval strengthens the bond between you, which will translate into a more secure partnership when you do meet each other’s parents.”</p><h2><strong>You Have Opposite Political Views</strong></h2><p>Some people can’t help but bring up politics over dinner or during any getting-to-know-you conversation. Relationship expert&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>Stef Safran</a>&nbsp;</strong>says the political climate is heated and plenty of families are already butting heads over these issues, let alone bringing someone new into the mix whose views may not match up. “The last thing you need is to bring your S.O. over and have a political argument during first meeting.”</p><h2><strong>There’s Pressure to Attend Family Gatherings</strong></h2><p>If it feels like it’s going to be too much—like, you know, an extended family reunion where all 30 of your aunts, uncles, and cousins will be present—then politely decline because you’re clearly not ready for this. “On the flip side, ask yourself why it’s so important for you to bring home that new guy or gal you’re dating,” says Amann. “Is it to avoid ‘looking’ single in front of family and friends? Thrusting that new person into a family situation is stressful and could send a budding relationship into a nosedive. Be clear on your own motives.”</p><h2><strong>You’re Not Sure About Your Future</strong></h2><p>Maybe you made plans to meet families before coming to the realization that s/he is not the best person for you. Regardless, Em says, “if you argue so much you’re an emotional wreck half the time, if you secretly resent your partner to the point where you are a simmering cauldron of passive aggressiveness, or if you’re just not sure they’re the one for you, call it off. Say you don’t think this is the right time.” If you doubt you’re going to last, don’t drag family into it.</p><h2><strong>You’ve Brought Several Other Partners Home</strong></h2><p>Sometimes parents don’t have much dating experience or haven’t been there in so long that they just don’t get the intricacies of the modern dating scene. “Many people who have been coupled up for long time forget that singles date a lot more people to find ‘the one,'” says Safran. “If you know that your parents might complain that you bring too many people around them, better to hold back and let more time pass before you introduce them.”</p><h2><strong>You’re Not Exclusive Yet</strong></h2><p>If you’re still swiping right and texting flirty messages with others, it’s too soon to make parental introductions because it’s clear you’re not exclusive yet, says Hall. Meeting the family can give off the impression that you are exclusive, and while your relationship status is ultimately your business, you also want to avoid having parents jump to conclusions about the seriousness of your situation.</p><h2><strong>You Haven’t Told Your Parents Much About Him or Her</strong></h2><p>Have you even told your family that you’re seeing someone? Does your partner’s family know about you? If you’ve barely mentioned the fact that you’re seeing someone, it’ll be kind of awkward to just show up at their house feeling like a complete stranger. Give your parents, siblings, or whoever they’ll be meeting a basic briefing of who this person is and what they mean to you before you bring them into a situation together.</p><h2><strong>There’s Still Talk About the Ex</strong></h2><p>If either of your families still brings up the ex and how great they were, it’s not a good time to bring home a new partner. Wait until the ex is completely out of everyone’s minds. Families can get attached and may compare someone new to someone old. It’s just not fair to you or your partner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8uorZ5lo5rFcIOPcGxya1%2Botqi60mawqK2imnqvu9NmqZ6ZlK56tbuMppyerF2ptaZ5xZqkoqSpZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
