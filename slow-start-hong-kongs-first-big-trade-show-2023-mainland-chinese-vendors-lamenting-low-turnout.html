There are not a lot of flights and it is too expensive. They would rather we fly over to the West and attend exhibitions there,” she added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our company signed up last October even though we might need to quarantine when we return. We haven’t had an in-person fair in three years. It’s so much better if buyers can see and test the real product. This fair in Hong Kong is a must-come for us.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She also noted visitor numbers for the event had taken a huge dip compared to the previous in-person showcase in January 2020, which occurred amid the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Turnout for the mega event on Monday morning comprised a few hundred buyers from countries such as Turkey, India and Malaysia, who browsed the latest wares from exhibitors as staff handed out product brochures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/09/76c04807-9b6c-425f-9e17-2090fdc52c12_3d292de6.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jackson Lam, the general manager of a toy retailer based in Guangdong province, agreed the event was much quieter than in previous years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In the past, it was more bustling, but this year we haven’t seen a lot of international guests, which are our target audience. Maybe it takes time for people to come back to Hong Kong for business,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Distributor Oguz Karahan, who was browsing prams and playpens to sell back in Turkey, said his team had been looking forward to the fair since deciding to attend two months ago, despite Hong Kong retaining some Covid-19 restrictions at the time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s my first time at the fair and in Hong Kong, and I also met many of our fellow distributors from Istanbul here, everyone is here to check out suppliers from mainland China,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/09/2a9bb294-b9f9-4da4-a75f-8e68b295e031_686e78c9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hellen Tang Xu, manager of a company selling children’s ride-on buggies, said the border reopening had made it easier to bring in Shenzhen-based staff “to take part in exhibitions here”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Speaking to local media, Sophia Chong Suk-fan, the council’s deputy executive director, said the number of foreign exhibitors had slowly increased since Hong Kong started rolling back entry curbs in September.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More than half of participants at recent trade fairs were foreigners compared with just 10 per cent of those who joined the International ICT expo last October, she added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This year would also feature no less than 30 medium to large-scale events, including an international jewellery showcase in March that had already received over 2,000 applications from prospective exhibitors, Chong said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Over half of the applicants for the jewellery show are from overseas, a third of which are from the mainland,” she noted.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong malls chase after mainlanders with HK$18 million in perks as border reopens</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As the border has just reopened, things will not bounce back immediately but we think the industry will pick up faster in 2023.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bernard Chan Pak-li, acting commerce and economic development secretary, said a preparation period of at least six months was needed for such events and expected more mainlanders would attend and take part in the rest of this year’s exhibitions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Authorities also intended to provide HK$1.4 billion (US$179 million) in support for the conventions and exhibitions industry from July to help speed up recovery, he said, calling the return of quarantine-free travel and the subsiding pandemic a “perfect time for visitors, businesses and event organisers to come back to Hong Kong”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the same day, Stephen Phillips, the head of the city’s investment promotion arm, InvestHK, embarked on his week-long visit to Indonesia and Singapore to tout Hong Kong as an attractive business destination, as well as opportunities in the Greater Bay Area.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZon6iml2K4sLrGZpycp56kurp7wKuropucmnx0fo9vaG1uX6i5sMOMrKuaqqRitbC6xmaiqKaXqHqntdGsq2aamZx6tb7AnZxmq5ikxG5%2Bj2tqZqWRnrutrc2dZJygmaOytLGMr5ynnJ%2BnwG64wKacp6yZo7RuuM6wZK2toqO8tsA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
