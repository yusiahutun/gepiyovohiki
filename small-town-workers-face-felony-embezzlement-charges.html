Tiffany Wynn, 43, was working as a manager at the Subway in Sandersville when a district manager found evidence of fraud and passed on his findings to the Sandersville Police Department, Sgt. Elizabeth Walley said.
“We received a paper trail going back to last year, and the numbers just didn’t add up,” Walley said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A manager at the store provided video surveillance along with voided receipts and other evidence that showed her getting cash for use to buy lottery tickets, Investigator Kyle Pickett of the Ellisville Police Department said. The total taken amounts to more than $1,000, so it is a felony, Pickett said.</p><p>Fletcher was arrested on Thursday evening and spent the night in jail then was released after posting $1,000 bond on Friday morning after her initial appearance in Ellisville Municipal Court.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcL%2FMmqOlZaSkxK951qippJ2iqHqnrcKeZJ%2BdnKS7unnEppmesqqhsq6xza1knKCRp7Smv46aqa2hk6GyoK3Fam5waZZpeqSDl21kammVmnp6f8BxZHKaY2iGdH2Ybm1rcF6dwa64</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
