Jennifer Fiedler sings lead on this tormented love song, progressively shedding composure with each successive lyric. Her ex-lover has a tendency to drink and dial, and that's something she can't deal with any longer. During &#34;Hey Whiskey,&#34; she's begging the bottle to put him down, because she cannot.

The song is a throwback to a time when vivid imagery and real sorrow mattered, but it's produced to fit neatly beside any two on the radio. You feel and maybe relate to her hesitant desires, and even though she never says it, one knows where all those late night, whiskey-fueled phone calls end.</p><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong>:&nbsp;Smithfield have found success on SiriusXM the Highway.</p><p><strong>Watch Smithfield Perform "Our World" Live:</strong></p><p><strong>The Best Songs of 2016 So Far?
