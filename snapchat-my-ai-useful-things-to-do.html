However, My AI is designed to be more conversational and also offers a few extra perks. Here are a few of the cool things you can do with it.</p><h2 id=solve-math-problems>1. Solve Math Problems</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/a-screenshot-of-the-d-d-5e-prompt-in-my-ai-s-chat.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-answering-that-the-shot-will-be-made-with-disadvantage.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-explaining-how-it-arrived-at-its-answer-using-the-pythagorean-theorem.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>While you can easily use a calculator for simple sums and percentage calculations, My AI could be better for more applicative math problems in realistic scenarios.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For example, while we were playing a Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition game, the rogue in our party stood on a 150ft tall tower and tried to use a longbow to shoot a target 80ft away from the tower's base. We wanted to figure out how far the arrow would have to travel to hit the target so we would know if it was within the rogue’s advantage range.My AI was able to draw on D&D 5E’s rules of combat, do some quick Pythagorean theorem calculations, and figure out that the arrow would have to travel 175ft to hit the target. Meaning that it’s not in the rogue’s advantage range, but instead, his attack roll will be made with disadvantage.</p><p>However, you should still use some discretion when using My AI for math problems. Probe it to show how it arrived at its answer because it might be wrong. My AI also suffers from some of <a href=#>the limitations that ChatGPT has</a>.</p><h2 id=run-text-based-games>2. Run Text-Based Games</h2><p>If you’re a fan of open-ended text-based games, you might be in for a lot of fun with My AI. Unlike the free version of ChatGPT, which is restricted by crowded servers and a limited number of prompts per session, My AI can provide you with endless, unlimited fun if you tell it to run an adventure game for you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you have no idea where to start, you can use this prompt to get you going: “Let’s play a text-adventure game where you will work as the computer hosting the game, and I the player. Start the game in a random fantasy setting and give me six relevant items in my inventory.”</p><p>Here’s what our game looked like:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-starting-a-text-adventure-game-with-a-prompt.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-showing-the-result-of-reading-a-parchment-in-the-game.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-generating-in-game-dialogue-with-one-of-the-guards.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>There are more detailed game prompts for those eager to have a more robust gaming experience. You can find one such example in our guide on <a href=#>using ChatGPT as a detailed text adventure game</a>.</p><h2 id=summarize-books-and-movies>3. Summarize Books and Movies</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-summarizing-the-first-episode-of-the-office.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-detailing-more-of-what-happens-in-the-first-episode-of-the-office.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-finding-an-episode-of-the-office-based-on-a-prompt.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Summaries can be useful for getting an idea of what happens in books or movies, and My AI can save you the hassle of having to Google a summary.</p><p>You can use summaries for essays, projects, or just to find out if you’ve seen an episode of a show. Here, we used My AI to figure out if we’ve seen the first episode of The Office.We also used it to figure out what episode exactly Michael Scott promises to stop making “that’s what she said” jokes. This feature can help you figure out specific episodes in long series or book chapters instead of manually scanning through them.</p><h2 id=make-recommendations>4. Make Recommendations</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-recommending-a-nearby-taco-place.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-making-book-recommendations-based-on-interest.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Snapchat’s My AI is designed to give recommendations when it can. It sometimes, unprompted, suggests places to visit during conversations based on your location and previously mentioned hobbies. But you can still be direct and prompt it to give you recommendations based on things it knows about you.</p><p>If you want more recommendations, you can also <a href=#>use Snapchat’s Snap Map to view restaurant recommendations</a>.</p><h2 id=provide-directions-to-a-place>5. Provide Directions to a Place</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-describing-the-location-of-a-taco-restaurant.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-describing-the-location-of-a-stadium-and-what-it-looks-like.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>Google Maps is still your best bet, but My AI can give you prose-form information on where a place is. This could be especially useful if you’re already familiar with the city you’re in. It will tell you the street location and identify useful landmarks to navigate to it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It can also give you detailed descriptions of the place, allowing you to use key features to pinpoint exactly where you’re looking for.Furthermore, My AI is great for letting you know if a place has a location or utility you want. For example, you can ask it if there’s a metro in a city you’re visiting and save you the trouble of looking for one through other means.</p><h2 id=identify-objects-plants-and-animals-in-photos>6. Identify Objects, Plants, and Animals in Photos</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/a-photo-of-a-dog-lying-down-ready-to-send-to-my-ai.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-commenting-on-and-describing-a-picture-of-a-dog.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>You can use My AI’s photo feature to identify objects, animals, and plants. Its accuracy might not be the best, but it could be helpful to give you a start in the right direction. It’s also a fun way to liven up the conversation with the AI.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To take a photo and send it to my AI, tap the <strong>camera</strong> icon on the left-hand side of the chat. Make sure to take a clear image, and My AI will comment on what it sees. You can also take selfies of yourself and send them to My AI, and it will drop comments on what actions it sees you doing.</p><h2 id=translate-pieces-of-text-for-you>7. Translate Pieces of Text for You</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-translating-from-english-to-french-and-offering-the-pronunciation.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-translating-text-from-french-back-to-english-then-japanese.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-changing-japanese-styles-to-hiragana-then-to-a-transilteration.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>My AI is conversant in French, Spanish, German, Italian, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Portuguese, and many more. You can copy text from other places and paste it into its chat, then ask it to translate it from that to whatever language you want.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can also use it as a tourist to aid you in speaking the local language since it can translate text, and you can ask it how to pronounce the words. It doesn’t end at pronunciation either, My AI knows how to transliterate, and you can use it to change languages in letters you can’t read to transliterations you can read.</p><h2 id=suggest-snapchat-lenses>8. Suggest Snapchat Lenses</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/prompt-for-alien-lens-in-my-ai-chat.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/my-ai-recommending-an-aliens-lens-to-use.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/alien-lens-activated-in-snapchat.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>Finding the right Snapchat lens can be very time-consuming. But you can use My AI to speed up that process by recommending lenses based on your prompt.</p><h2 id=help-my-ai-grow>Help My AI Grow</h2><p>As it is, large language models and, consequently, My AI still have a long way to go. You can help My AI’s growth and probably fast-track features you would like to see by submitting feedback.</p><p>As it stands, there are still plenty of things you can try out with prompts to My AI. Try a few out to get familiar with the tool.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiqp5mgmLWiwIymsGaZmWLCtLHFrqNmrJieu6i%2FjK2mZpyfZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
