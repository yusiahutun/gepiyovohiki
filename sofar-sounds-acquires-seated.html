We know how many Sofar artists rely on playing shows to connect with fans and make a living, and we wanted to do whatever we could to support the artist community through this, continuing the work we’d been doing to build Sofar into an even better resource for independent artists,” Sofar Sounds said in a blog post announcing the deal.</p><p>“As part of that effort, we’re really excited to announce that artists services company Seated is joining the Sofar team—a huge step in our journey to support this global artist community. Seated has built some amazing tools that enable musicians to promote their shows and better connect with their top fans. Together, we’re going to be able to do even more for artists both digitally and in person when live music returns.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ35wfJFoaG5no6Szor6MrKauppSoeqKv0K6gq52jYsCmrdOem2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
