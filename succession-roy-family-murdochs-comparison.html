Before Succession, the showrunner wrote a screenplay called Murdoch, a drama that details the family’s discussion about Rupert Murdoch’s successor on his 78th birthday. As fans of Succession will note, the series premiere follows the Roy family’s discussion about patriarch Logan Roy’s successor on his 80th birthday.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2018, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/succession-1202661717/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Armstrong told " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Armstrong told </a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/succession-1202661717/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Variety class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Variety</a>, “This is a fictional family,” but that he knows a “good deal” about his subject.

At the end of the first episode, Logan suffers a near-fatal stroke, which causes his children to discuss who should take over the company should he not make it through. Though he lives, his health remains an issue for the majority of the season. Still, he refuses to retire.</p><img alt="Elder, Official, Glasses, " title="Elder, Official, Glasses, " width=1000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/succession-comp-gettyimages-1127185240.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty/HBO</span><p>From left: Rupert Murdoch; Brian Cox as Logan Roy on HBO’s Succession</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://newscorp.com/leader/rupert-murdoch/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rupert Murdoch" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Rupert Murdoch</a>, now 88, continues to serve as executive chairman of News Corp and co-chairman of Fox Corporation, even though he’s well past the average retiring age and has offspring seemingly capable of succeeding him. In 2018, Murdoch suffered a serious back injury (about which he told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rupert-murdoch-reassures-friends-worried-his-health-i-m-doing-great-1096041 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, “I’m doing great,” and went back to the office weeks later).

At the beginning of Season 1, Kendall Roy is expected to be announced as Logan Roy’s heir apparent. Instead, Logan refuses to retire and eventually fires his son for trying to overthrow him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rupert Murdoch’s son, Lachlan Murdoch, hasn’t attempted a vote of no confidence in his dad (that we know of), but he abruptly <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jul/29/newscorporation.citynews data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=resigned class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">resigned</a> from his executive post at News Corp and as publisher of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://nypost.com/2005/07/30/post-publisher-lachlan-murdoch-resigns/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New York Post" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">New York Post</a>. Before his departure, most assumed Lachlan would be Rupert’s successor, just like how Succession fans (and Kendall himself), assumed Kendall would be the obvious next-in-line.</p><img alt="Jerry Hall Marries Media Mogul Rupert Murdoch At St Brides Church" title="Jerry Hall Marries Media Mogul Rupert Murdoch At St Brides Church" width=3068 height=2403 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rupert-murdoch-arrives-at-st-brides-church-in-london-news-photo-1570457970.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Karwai Tang</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Rupert Murdoch (center) with sons James (left) and Lachlan (right) the day after his wedding to Jerry Hall in London in 2016.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">James Murdoch, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3132678.stm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said to be the rebel" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">said to be the rebel</a> of the family, lines up perfectly with Roman Roy. Roman worked for Waystar Royco’s film division, where he was involved with a movie he hates called The Biggest Turkey in the World. James, the former CEO of 21st Century Fox, was also the chairman of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/26/rupert-murdochs-sky-reign-to-end-as-fox-sells-all-shares-to-comcast data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sky before Comcast" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sky before Comcast</a> acquired it in its entirety.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Further, James was embroiled in the investigation of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. He claimed he had no knowledge of the wrongdoings. At the end of Season 1, Roman oversees a rocket launch that ultimately explodes, and Season 2 sees him under investigation for what went wrong. In Roman’s case, he is well aware that he rushed the launch in order to make it happen on Shiv and Tom’s wedding day.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Connor Roy is Logan’s eldest child, and has a different mother from half-siblings Kendall, Roman, and Shiv. Connor relies on his inheritance exclusively to make a living, though he is thinking about starting a podcast on Napoleonic history. He has no ambitions within Waystar Royco beyond reaping its riches, because he believes his family’s money can help him one day become president of the United States—a job he feels qualified for because he is rich. Though these details don’t make Connor Roy an exact replica of Prudence Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch’s eldest child (who, like Connor, has a different mother than her half-siblings), Prudence does <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/12/murdoch200812 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="happen to be" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">happen to be</a> “the only one of [Rupert Murdoch's] children not directly competing for his business affections.”</p><img alt="Event, Job, Employment, Room, White-collar worker, Conversation, Management, " title="Event, Job, Employment, Room, White-collar worker, Conversation, Management, " width=2000 height=1333 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/c5ca1e50042bedf41561b34afb89bb35a3cfacc2d7ef2faaaca25ab7d0f0a82be325aedb5252a8dd59f91a54a10c601d-1570465806.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span><p>Kieran Culkin as Roman Roy, Jeremy Strong as Kendall Roy, Alan Ruck as Connor Roy, and Sarah Snook as Shiv Roy in HBO’s Succession.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Elisabeth Murdoch began her News Corp career at FX Networks. It appeared that she was being set up as a possible successor to her father, but she eventually left News Corp to start her own production company, Shine Limited. In 2011, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/8338635/Rupert-Murdochs-News-Corp-buys-daughters-Shine-Group-for-415m.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="News Corp bought Shine" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">News Corp bought Shine</a>. Now, there aren’t many correlations between Logan Roy’s daughter, Shiv, and Elisabeth beyond gender, ambition, and business savvy, but there is a common theme that exists among both of their desires to work independently of their fathers’ names—only to then be pulled back in. It’s a truth that rings true for all of the Roy siblings (including Connor). Now, who’s in need of some family therapy?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Season 1, Episode 7 deals with the aftermath of Kendall’s failed coup, with Logan Roy inviting all of his children (except Kendall) to a family therapy session at Connor’s New Mexico ranch. It … doesn’t go well. While the episode’s storyline makes sense for the season and its characters’ arc, it’s also one of the storylines directly “inspired” by the Murdochs. In 2011, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/11/Murdoch-Clan-Met-with-Family-Therapist-to-Discuss-News-Corps-Future data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair reported" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Vanity Fair reported</a> that the Murdochs met with a family therapist to discuss “the issue of succession” following the News of the World phone-hacking scandal that shook the company. Although, unlike the therapist on Succession, the Murdochs’ mediator did not lose his teeth as a result of diving into the shallow end of a swimming pool.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a22549cf-68b2-47e5-95e6-bd61dd2c8efb_1616511347.png alt="Headshot of Carrie Wittmer" title="Headshot of Carrie Wittmer" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Carrie is a Brooklyn-based entertainment journalist and critic with bylines in GQ, The Ringer, Vulture, The Cut, and more.
