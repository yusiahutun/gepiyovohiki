To improve your capacity in these areas, ask yourself some hard questions – and then answer them.</p><h3>1. Influence – Becoming a leader and gaining authority is hard work.</h3><p>People tend to make a few false assumptions on the way to becoming leaders. The first is, “I’m not a born leader.” Actually, almost no one is. Leadership is a learned skill, and anyone who embraces self-development can become a leader regardless of background or circumstances.</p><p>“Why has leadership become so important? Because people are recognizing that becoming a better leader changes lives.”</p><p>Some people think they’ll become leaders without making an effort. They believe just hanging around in the company and accumulating seniority is an automatic ticket to leadership. But seniority doesn’t align with influence or authority, unless you build up your ability to lead. So who advances to leadership positions? Almost always, it’s the people who’ve worked hard to prepare for leadership and to become better at it. How important is making yourself ready to lead? As the late John Wooden, UCLA’s famous basketball coach, put it, “When opportunity comes, it’s too late to prepare.” If you are ready to exercise influential leadership or aspire to become a stronger leader, ask yourself these questions:</p><ul><li>How would things change if you had greater influence over the people in your life and the events that take place around you?</li><li>Are you helping or harming other people? If you’re doing harm, how must you change your behavior?</li><li>Are your negative assumptions holding you back? If so, how can you adopt a more positive approach?</li></ul><h3>2. Judgment – To make time for your personal life and your work, you must be able to set priorities.</h3><p>Time may be today’s most precious commodity. No one ever gets enough. Thus, leaders must focus on what’s most important by working from priority lists they create to stay on top of their primary activities. This focus is essential for leaders who must attend to their own responsibilities while managing the needs of the team or unit they lead.</p><p>“For anyone who leads, the question is not, ‘Will my calendar be full?’ but ‘Who and what will fill my calendar?”</p><p>To work smarter, not harder, rethink how you handle your work and other activities, then institute time-saving changes. To operate more efficiently and get the most from the time you dedicate to leadership, ask:</p><ul><li>How would things change for you if you were more efficient?</li><li>What are the five most important things in your life? Which one is most important? Do you focus sufficient attention on these priorities?</li><li>What criteria do you use to determine what you care about most and govern your time accordingly?</li></ul><h3>3. Character – Leadership requires having good character; if this is a weak spot, you can build it up.</h3><p>Sooner or later, leaders who lack character will make mistakes, often egregious ones. Leadership demands strong ethics and moral character.</p><p>“What is the most difficult task any leader ever faces? Without a doubt, it is leading ourselves.”</p><p>If you are not happy with flaws in your character, improve them. You – and your mind – are flexible and pliable. You can become different than you are today. Some questions regarding character to ask and answer include:</p><ul><li>Are you selfish? Do you help others or offer sufficient praise? If you are acting selfishly, why?How can you become less self-centered?</li><li>Do the people you lead see you as fair and authentic? If not, what can you do to become more genuine and change their perceptions?</li><li>Do you govern your life and your leadership according to ethical and moral values? If not, why not? Where would you like to improve?</li></ul><h3>4. Agility – Managing positive change is an issue that leaders must master.</h3><p>The “plan ahead” acrostic lays out the change process, step by step:</p><ul><li>Predetermine the changes you need to make.</li><li>Lay out the steps you need to take.</li><li>Adjust what matters most to you.</li><li>Notify the most important people.</li><li>Allow the time you need to accept your changes.</li><li>Head directly into action.</li><li>Expect difficulties.</li><li>Always focus on your successes.</li><li>Daily review your progress.</li></ul><p>Planning ahead alerts you to the complexity of personal and organizational changes and challenges. Transforming organizations, particularly large ones, can call on all of a leader’s skills. If you are guiding or instituting change in your company – or if you perceive changes you should make in your life – ask yourself:</p><ul><li>Do you understand fostering positive change is the “true test of leadership?” How do you measure up?</li><li>What specific steps must you take to make changes?</li><li>What is your attitude toward emotions of the people you lead through the process of change? If you are generally dismissive, instead of accepting, how can you become more inclusive?</li></ul><h3>5. Problem-solving ability – Strong leaders see problems as opportunities.</h3><p>Life is never easy, so leaders must see the opportunities within each dilemma and become effective problem-solvers.Leaders who can’t solve problems do not lead for long.Problem-solving leaders share valuable insights and find new directions as they tackle thorny issues. To do a better job of tackling tough problems and seeing the opportunities within a challenge, ask yourself:</p><ul><li>Do you accept that life is tough? Once you accept that basic challenge, it may seem less daunting to move ahead, put issues into perspective and solve them.</li><li>Do you understand that as a leader, your life is not always your own? It also belongs to the people you lead, and their problems are your problems.</li><li>Are you adequately connected to the people you lead? If not, how can you make your interactions more meaningful?</li></ul><h3>6. Attitude – In leadership and in life, attitude is everything.</h3><p>The traits you admire in other people – positivity, tenacity, enthusiasm – often derive from their attitude.If you would like to have a more constructive, <a href=#>positive attitude</a>, consider:</p><ul><li>Whom do you most admire? What attributes distinguish this person from everyone else? How can you acquire some of these attributes?</li><li>Do you operate with a positive attitude? If not, can you improve your attitude?</li><li>How can you make determination, optimism or other positive feelings part of your mind-set?</li></ul><h3>7. Servant leadership – The main goal of leadership is to serve others.</h3><p>Do you serve others? That is leadership’s raison d’etre. This is why the concept of “leadership” is often referred to as “servant leadership.”</p><p>“The servant-leader is servant first…[This] begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve, to serve first. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead.” (author Robert Greenleaf)</p><p>The best way to tell if you’re truly serving those you lead is to see whether, under your direction, they’re growing as well-rounded individuals, becoming “healthier, wiser, freer” and “more autonomous.” Ask yourself:</p><ul><li>Are you serving the people you lead? If not, what can you do?</li><li>Do you add value to those around you? How can you begin?</li></ul><h3>8. Vision – Leaders with a sense of purpose and mission energize their teams.</h3><p>Vision is essential to leadership. Without a guiding mission or purpose, teams can’t be productive. Their energy dissipates and members lose focus. However, when vision drives a team’s work, it can thrive; members are happy because their work has meaning and purpose. Consider these questions:</p><ul><li>Do you have a vision? Do you pursue it?</li><li>Do those you lead share your vision?</li><li>Are you open to new ideas? If not, what can you do about this limitation?</li></ul><h3>9. Self-control – To lead others, you must have the self-discipline to lead yourself.</h3><p>Former US President Harry S. Truman once wrote, “In reading the lives of great men, I have found that the first victory they won was over themselves.” Self-discipline is the term for such private victories, and it is an essential leadership trait. Self-discipline is a form of personal engagement that is vital for leading others productively. It enables self-control.Ask yourself:</p><ul><li>Do you have a problem with self-discipline? If so, what gives you the most trouble? How can you improve in this area?</li><li>Can you accept “short-term difficulties” in order to succeed over the long run?</li><li>What tempts you most in life that brings negative consequences?</li></ul><h3>10. Personal growth – Seniority alone doesn’t make you a leader; you need to develop experience and expertise.</h3><p>No one wants to follow leaders with minimal experience and limited vistas, but the only way immature leaders can become seasoned is through experience and personal growth.</p><p>“Your capacity to grow will determine your capacity to lead.”</p><p>When it comes to leadership, seniority and age mean nothing on their own. Leaders who are older but no wiser or more knowledgeable than the people they lead will have a hard time earning their staff members’ respect. Growth, experience and mature vision count much more than age. Ask yourself these questions about your personal growth as a leader.</p><ul><li>What is the biggest obstacle in the way of becoming the most effective leader you can be?</li><li>Are you ready to commit to an ambitious program of personal growth?</li><li>Am I prepared to change how I live in order to grow?</li><li>How exactly do I want or need to change?</li></ul><h3>Strive to become the best leader you can be.</h3><p>Working to develop your leadership potential is a lifelong quest. As you answer these self-directed questions, consider where you are on that journey. Are you taking productive steps in the right direction?</p><p>“Your priorities are clearer, and you act on them more decisively. You’ve won character battles. You’ve been able to initiate change and solve problems with greater ability.”</p><p>Your role today can become your ground-floor for further developing yourself as a leader and working through the 10 core areas leaders must master. Make “never-stop-trying” your first rule of leadership development. That is, never stop trying to become the best leader you can be. You can turn to these “five levels of leadership” to develop your leadership growth “road map.”</p><li>Position – This is the lowest level of leadership influence. As a new leader, you have not yet developed influence over your team. You have an authoritative title, but not much else.</li><li>Permission – This leadership level rests on good relationships. Your success depends on friendly connections with the people you lead, not on rules and regulations. Respect your team members; they are giving you tacit “permission to lead.”</li><li>Production – This level is the arena where you can prove your leadership abilities and guide your team to produce positive results. By now you’ve internalized some crucial leadership lessons. You and your team are known for getting things done.</li><li>Personnel – Great leaders empower their teams and help their team members grow. At this level, you can help your team members develop into leaders themselves. Their progress builds and sustains a culture of loyalty that brings other future leaders into your orbit.</li><li>Pinnacle – Leaders at this level have earned a stellar reputation. Everyone knows they are great leaders, including people outside their company. They have the 10 traits of great leaders.</li><p>As a leader, you can never gather too much knowledge or too many useful insights. On the other hand, if you are a seasoned, senior leader, don’t fall into the trap of believing you’re too old to improve or learn new strategies. In his day, Pablo Casals was the world’s most accomplished cellist. He practiced for hours every day. When Casals was 81, someone asked him why he continued to practice so diligently. He answered, “Because I think I’m making progress.” That’s the right attitude to bring to the long-range project of developing yourself as a leader.</p><h2><span id=About_the_Author>About the Author</span></h2><p><strong>John C.
