In April, she opened <span class=s2>Becks Dessert Shop</span> in downtown Stuart. Decorated with a minimalist touch and exuding a vibe of joy, the shop is filled with treats made by Euvin, including best sellers like her themed dessert boxes, which range from 6 to 22 pieces, pop tarts (top flavors are lemon lavender and fruit loop), and decorated cookies. Euvin’s skills as both a baker and a creative artist allow her to create the perfect treats for her customers. She has been drawing since she was a little girl and brings an artistic flair to the kitchen.</p><p class=p1>“A lot of times, people have ideas of the desserts and cookies they want but don’t know how to translate that to a clean look,” she says. “I start with their ideas and minimize everything to create a very clean and chic result.” <span class=s2><i>820 SE Lincoln Ave., Stuart, <a href=# rel=noopener>becksdessertshop.com</a></i></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZLOwu8NmmKecXZm%2FqrrKaKmeq6SWwrOtza1kp52nqHy0w8Seq2asopqutb%2BMmqtmmpWYuLR5w56qrJ2iqXq0tM6pZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
