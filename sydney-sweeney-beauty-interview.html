While we await her Marvel debut in Madame Web, the 25-year-old actress will reprise her captivating role as Cassie Howard in angsty teen drama Euphoria, and stars in Reality – an American whistleblower drama premiering at the Berlin International Film Festival next month. With equally attention-grabbing moments off screen and on red carpets, the formidable star has become a darling of the fashion and beauty worlds, too. Her latest partnership here is with Giorgio Armani, having become the luxury house’s face of its forthcoming My Way Parfum – a free-spirited-feeling feminine fragrance that chimes well with the LA local.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I shower in it every day!” she tells me of her love of perfume. “I apply it everywhere.” And this particular juice? “I felt like My Way Parfum really captured who I was as a woman – there's so many different notes that I relate to, whether it's the vanilla, the woodsey, all the flowers…”</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Maude Apatow: Inside my beauty bag" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screenshot-2022-11-28-at-12-35-28-1669638940.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sweeney tells me of her multifaceted relationship with beauty; she subscribes to a minimal aesthetic off-duty but also feels empowered to experiment. “I always remember when I was really little watching my mom do her skincare routine, and she would lather lotion all over her face. I was like, ‘what is she doing?’. I was trying to figure out, ‘what is this process that you do?’.” But it wasn’t long before Hollywood introduced her to the concept, too. “Definitely a lot of my beauty influence came from movies and TV shows when I was little,” she says citing Anne Hathaway’s makeover scene in The Princess Diaries as a stand-out memory.</p><img alt="sydney sweeney" title='The 2022 Met Gala Celebrating "In America: An Anthology of Fashion" - Arrivals' width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sydney-sweeney-attends-in-america-an-anthology-of-fashion-news-photo-1651566388.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Taylor Hill</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Were her style choices we see now determined by relocating to LA from Idaho, at the formative age of 14, in the pursuit of her career? “I definitely learned a lot when I moved to LA,” she recalls, “and learned that there's no boundary or no box that beauty and style was put in – that you can be whoever you want. And that was really inspiring”. Sartorially, as much as spiritually, she’s grounded, though. “I feel like I've always stayed true to Syd and just kind of sprinkled in parts of LA.” She tells me that even as her public profile has skyrocketed, mirroring the remarkable successes of Euphoria and The White Lotus – where Sweeney’s role in season one courted critical acclaim – her identity hasn’t really wavered. “I think that my philosophy is always to kind of stay true to myself and just do things my way. Being me, of course, is what’s going to make me feel good, but I have the privilege of being able to play so many different characters and be so many people and learn so much from them. And at the end of the day being able to go home and be Syd is a really good feeling.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This, and not fresh out of the make-up chair, is when she feels most beautiful. “When I am with my dog, on a hike, or at home watching TV. Just being normal. I’m definitely a little bit more of like a make-up free, T-shirt and jeans kinda girl.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sweeney has, however, become synonymous with Euphoria’s zeitgeist-capturing make-up looks which sparked a beauty movement amongst viewers – and beyond. The fantastical face gems, graphic liners, exaggerated lashes, and loud lips formed a visual feast that encouraged mass dopamine dressing above the neck post-pandemic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Oh my gosh, it's so exciting,” Sweeney says of the phenomena. “And it's a really crazy and fun thing to watch, because you work so hard with your cast, or Donni [Davy] – the make-up artist on the show – on creating these looks and trying to think of things that are fun, new and exciting and also work for your character and bring out different aspects of who they are. So, to watch all the fans and the viewers kind of take that and expand on it with their own personality is really amazing. And I hope that it continues to inspire people to embrace who they are.” It was Sweeney’s Euphoria experience that echoed the sentiments she absorbed in LA, that there's no boundaries in beauty. “That is, I think, one of Donni’s biggest philosophies: that there are no rules and we can do anything that we want to do.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, what does Sweeney do make-up-wise when she’s left to her own devices?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She had “a rocky start”, she shares. “I struggled with finding make-up, because all throughout high school I struggled with really bad cystic acne; I have combination skin so I get oily but then it gets dry and peels and I pick – and I could never find a make-up that, one would sit on my face and worked, and two wouldn’t break me out.” Then, six years ago, her make-up artist introduced her to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.armanibeauty.co.uk/makeup/face/medium-coverage-foundation/luminous-silk-foundation/AP10101.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Armani Beauty Luminous Silk Foundation" data-vars-ga-product-id=816da870-b803-4c65-bcd6-0cccac9de664 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href=https://www.armanibeauty.co.uk/makeup/face/medium-coverage-foundation/luminous-silk-foundation/AP10101.html data-product-url=https://www.armanibeauty.co.uk/makeup/face/medium-coverage-foundation/luminous-silk-foundation/AP10101.html data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.armanibeauty.co.uk%2Fmakeup%2Fface%2Fmedium-coverage-foundation%2Fluminous-silk-foundation%2FAP10101.html" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=£31.15 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=e295c37a-9e2d-4aff-9d2e-6688d8a20e60 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Foundation class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Armani Beauty Luminous Silk Foundation</a> – an industry cult classic. “I could not believe that no one had shown me it before or I didn't know what this was.
