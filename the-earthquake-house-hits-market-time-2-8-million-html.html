The Earthquake House was built by David Ming-Li Lowe, and was recognized in 1994 by the American Institute of Architects as one of the country's most important projects. 
Along with steel as the major structural framework, the home is the first in America built on viscous-damper base isolators to protect it from earthquakes.
