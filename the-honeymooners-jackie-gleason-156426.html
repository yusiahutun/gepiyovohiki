But then came The Honeymooners. Think about it: <a href=#>I Love Lucy</a>, <a href=#>The Andy Griffith Show</a>, Leave It to Beaver, My Three Sons — usually there was domestic bliss for the most part. But that wasn’t the case with the <a href=#>Classic TV</a> series that starred <strong>Jackie Gleason</strong> as bus driver Ralph Kramden, <strong>Audrey Meadows</strong> as his long-suffering wife, Alice; <strong>Art Carney</strong> as dim-witted but lovable best friend and sidekick, Ed Norton; and the last living member of The Honeymooners <strong>Joyce Randolph</strong> as his wife, Trixie.</p><p>The two couples lived in a Bensonhurst apartment in Brooklyn, New York, struggling to get by. And it was exactly that struggle, and wanting to break free of it, that propelled much of the comedy. Ralph was the get-rich-quick scheming, short-tempered, soft-hearted guy who was always striving for greatness, but never made it out of that two-room Brooklyn apartment. And that’s one of the main attractions for even the most casual of viewers: the characters are so identifiable. As Jackie himself said at the time, “Everything we did could have happened. People like the show, because we are them.”</p><p><strong>Scroll down and see for yourself as we take this little trip back in time to 328 Chauncey Street and how Jackie created a true classic.</strong></p><p>Be sure to check out and <a href=#>subscribe to our Classic TV & Film Podcast</a> for interviews with your favorite stars!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tn55lmKS7psXMqKannaKoequtwqSgnmWXobKiv86nZGptZml%2Fd3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
