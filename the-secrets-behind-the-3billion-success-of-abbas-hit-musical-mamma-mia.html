But ABBA's Mamma Mia wasn’t always destined to become the Super Trouper it’s turned out to be.
In an exclusive interview with The Sun, to mark 20 years of the show since it hit the West End, Mamma Mia writer Catherine Johnson explains exactly how a humble idea from producer Judy Craymer pitched to ABBA’s Benny, 72, and Bjorn, 73, 22 years ago went on to become the fifth longest running musical in West End history."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I'd never done anything like this before. Nobody was raising my expectations up too much.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SHOWBIZ-MammaMia-081838jpg-JS481382908.jpg><p>“I think the theatre was only booked for three months. I was like ‘Let's get this open. It's been really hard work but get this open and then you've got to get on with something else.’”</p><p>But nothing could quite have prepared her for the stratospheric success of the musical.</p><p>Two years after it opened on the West End, a Broadway version began which ran for 14 years and the show has now toured in 50 countries and all six continents.</p><p>The success of Mamma Mia has also paved way for hits like Queen’s We Will Rock You, Frankie Valli and The Four Season’s Jersey Boys and Carole King’s recent West End hit Beautiful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Music_Review_-_Mamma_Mia_Here_We_Go_Again_71726jpg-0df08jpg-JS420955244.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2495_D042_00012R_CROPjpg-JS419367286.jpg><p>Producer Judy Craymer, a trailblazer in jukebox musicals, had been the person to approach Benny and Bjorn about the idea back in the nineties when she was working as an assistant to composer Tim Rice.</p><p>Catherine was brought on board by Judy to write the story in 1997 – two years before the show opened on the West End.</p><p>She explains that Benny and Bjorn went for her idyllic Greek backdrop straight away with Donna and her daughter Sophie as central characters.</p><p>But a few “flourishes” were lost along the way including a crooked casino owner called Stanley who met the cutting room floor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2495_D043_00051R_CROPjpg-JS419910633.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cherJPG-JS413013402.jpg><p>Catherine goes on: “The main story line Benny and Bjorn went for immediately. There were a couple of flourishes to the story line that got lost after the very first treatment. But in many ways it has stayed intact from what would have been 22 years ago.</p><p>“It was the addition of a character called Stanley who was a crooked casino owner and that was probably to shoe horn Money Money Money in. And thankfully Stanley bit the dust after a very short time. Not one of my finest moments I've got to say.”</p><p>After a solid ten years as a stage show, Judy then pitched the idea of a film version to studio Universal.</p><p>All that was missing was the star cast.</p><p>Catherine explains: “I think Judy was clever in not rushing off and getting the movie made too quickly. She wanted it to come at the right time. She wanted Mamma Mia the stage musical to have its own impact around the world, which it ended up doing.</p><p>“And she wanted to keep director Phyllida Lloyd and me on board as well. By the time we talked to Universal, ten years later, we were able to say ‘we know what works’. The show really proved what worked and we didn't have to put too much in there.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/37601090obj-JS4434870.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DMB-The_20th_anniversary_performance_of_Mamma_Mia_at_the_Novello_Theatre01JPG-JS481390002.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Mamma Mia! Cast reunite as final trailer is released</span><p>Hollywood star <a href=#>Meryl Streep</a>, 69, had only been a pipe dream for Catherine, Judy and director Phyllida.</p><p>Catherine explains: “I can remember they went to talk to her and getting text messages from them just before they'd gone in.</p><p>“I was thinking 'wow', it changed everything again. You know there's going to be a movie and suddenly it's going to be a Meryl Streep movie and that's very different.”</p><p>The film smashed box office targets bringing home £500million.</p><p>Ten years later the idea of a prequel-sequel was bandied around but Catherine chose to stay out of it.</p><p>She says: “The main reason is because I wasn't interested in writing a prequel. As a writer I don't want to know the ending before I start so I obviously know what happened before. It just wasn't for me and Phyllida wasn't involved so I was happy to let it go.”</p><p>The prequel-sequel, starring superstar <a href=#>Cher</a>, 72, once again smashed targets and was named the most successful musical sequel at the box office.</p><p>But even now after two hit films and 20 years on the West End stage, Benny and Bjorn aren’t willing to let the lucrative Mamma Mia brand rest.</p><p>While rumours swirl about a third film, MAMMA MIA!
