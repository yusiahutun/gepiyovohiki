'That's how I knew what she was doing.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>During the drives, Rebecca told Julie she was opening&nbsp;a clinic for children and families and tried to recruit Julie to work there, before asking for a copy of her passport and money. Having recruited other people in the area, one woman even quit her job as an au pair to work for Rebecca.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'That's when I realised it was a scam,' Julie said. 'An unqualified person doing that, then looking for passport copies, then money.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>People at the school started to ask questions about the qualifications of their child's new therapist.

This was apparently being organised by the church who were covering half the cost.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lucy said she needed a £500 deposit to secure the trip - which would be raising money for the domestic abuse refuge she claimed to run. The community rallied and Lynn's mother made up 400-500 euros worth of food packages for the refuge.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As the Lapland trip drew nearer, Lynn said she had been trying to find a specialist nurse to care for her youngest daughter. It was at this point Lucy said she would take Sofia to Lapland alone and Lynn and her youngest could join them later once care was organised.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>All Lucy needed was Sofia's passport and birth certificate, Lynn said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She had zoned in on my Sofia and I still to this day believe she looked for a signature from me so she could bring Sofia herself to Lapland.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Suspicions in the community escalated when one of Lynn's friends, a woman called Pauline whose son is autistic, said Lucy had also tried to convince her to hand over her son's passport.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lucy was reported to the Garda for trying to scam families in the community out of money and passports, but she was let go without charge.&nbsp;She packed up and left County Geery that same night.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox">The au pair: Lucy Hart</h2><p class=mol-para-with-font>Two years before there was Lucy Fitzwilliam, there was a 26-year-old woman called Lucy Hart.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bonnie, not her real name for anonymity, a woman in her 40s from Tullamore, had been looking an au pair to help look after her children.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She came across Lucy on an au pair website in 2014. Lucy said she was experienced in childcare and following a quick video call, Bonnie hired her.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She was so convincing, and really lovely in the interview we had,' said Bonnie.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-f8fc13b56fafea77 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/12/07/11/78688601-12832205-image-m-35_1701950347038.jpg height=972 width=634 alt="In a video for the ALS ice bucket challenge, Lucy nominated her mother 'Jane' to take part and her employer Bonnie's children poured the water over her head" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>In a video for the ALS ice bucket challenge, Lucy nominated her mother 'Jane' to take part and her employer Bonnie's children poured the water over her head</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bonnie and her children 'loved' Lucy and she quickly became part of the family - regaling them with her interesting stories about her previous au pair jobs and her own family.&nbsp;Lucy said she was adopted and that her mother Jane Hart lived in the United States. She said her mother was the 'main supplier for sandpaper for B&Q'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In a video for the ALS ice bucket challenge, Lucy nominated her mother 'Jane' and Bonnie's children poured the water over her head.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lucy soon opened up to Bonnie about her love life, saying she was dating a man in the UK who had two children from a previous relationship.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bonnie also received an insight into Lucy's tragic past, as she told her that her previous fiance Liam had had motor neuron disease and killed himself by hanging.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lucy said she had found him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The pair's friendship grew but things changed during Christmas in 2014 - when Lucy accused Bonnie's children of stealing her money and engagement ring. Bonnie did not believe her children would do such a thing and the relationship began to break down.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bonnie went back over many of Lucy's elaborate stories and found they did not add up, so one day challenged her au pair as she launched into yet another tale. Kind and smiley Lucy was quickly replaced with an angry woman who accused Bonnie of attacking her and stormed out of the room.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Things remained tense until one day in January when Lucy said she was going on a writing retreat and disappeared.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After a few weeks, Bonnie accepted Lucy was not coming back and went into the room she had been staying in. In the wardrobe she found piles of documents and one truly chilling letter that made her 'blood run cold'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Among shopping lists and legal documents was a statement about visitation rights for Lucy's child - a child whose name matched the one she claimed was her boyfriend's from another relationship.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>More chilling still, Bonnie came across a statement.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The statement read: 'I stand shoulder to shoulder with the coroner and I did not murder my daughter.

Her lies included her mother having cancer and her being pregnant and miscarrying.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Aged 18, Samantha was dating a boy called Liam. She went as far as to set up a website to plan their 'wedding'. There was no wedding.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The pair split up some time later and aged 20, Samantha started a degree in Occupational Therapy at York University.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, Samantha later discovered she was pregnant and left university in her first year, returning home to Shropshire. She gave birth to a daughter called Martha in 2008.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tragically, just four months later, Martha died.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A five-month inquest found Martha had died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) - a result which appeared to vindicate Samantha, who seemed to have taken the inquest as an accusation.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was at this point Samantha made the statement later found by Bonnie in Tullamore six years later.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I stand shoulder to shoulder with the coroner, and I did not murder my daughter,' it read.

Claudia gave the excited couple a glowing review of Samantha.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Having never met her face to face, the couple gave Samantha £1,200 out of their savings to cover the cost of the insemination kit, legal fees and other expenses.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sadly the baby never came, and as both Samantha and Claudia avoided the couple's messages, they realised they had been duped. The police were contacted and a 23-year-old woman was arrested at her home in Shropshire.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The case came to trial in 2011 and Samantha pleaded guilty to fraud. She received&nbsp;a suspended sentence of 9 months' imprisonment and a fine of £1890 to be paid to the couple.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But what the trial also revealed was that Samantha and Claudia were the same person. Claudia did not exist.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A year later, Samantha gave birth to a second child with the man she had been dating but due to mental health problems, the father was given sole custody.
