The outlet notes his lump sum is separate from his ex</span><a href=#> <b>Gisele Bündchen</b></a><span>, who has a reported $400 million fortune of her own.

The former couple announced their divorce in October 2022 after 13 years of marriage.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“In recent days, my wife and I finalized our divorce from one another after 13 years of marriage,” Tom wrote on Instagram at the time. “We arrived at this decision amicably and with gratitude for the time we spent together. We are blessed with beautiful and wonderful children who will continue to be the center of our world in every way.

After falling in love with football as a teen, he went on to play at the University of Michigan, where he graduated in 1999, according to</span><a href=#><span> SportsCasting.com</span></a><span>. During that time, the sports star’s career kicked off when he was drafted by the New England Patriots in 2000.</span></p><p><span>From that moment, Tom has established one of the most memorable careers in all of NFL history. Not only was he with the New England Patriots for 20 seasons — which is the NFL record — but the beloved superstar also took home many other awards and accolades. Per</span><a href=#><span> Celebrity Net Worth</span></a><span>, he has more division wins than any other quarterback, he led the Patriots to eight consecutive AFC championship wins and he has been selected for 14 Pro Bowls.</span></p><p><span>In addition, Tom holds the record of five Super Bowl MVP Awards, plus three NFL MVP Awards. So far, he’s played in 10 Super Bowls — another record. The sports guru won his seventh Super Bowl in February 2021 against the Kanas City Chiefs.</span></p><p><span>Tom wasn’t wearing a Patriots jersey, though, as he took the field during the Super Bowl. In March 2020, he</span><a href=#><span> announced his departure from the New England team</span></a><span> after two decades. After that, he played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Tom, Gisele and their kids, Jack, Ben and Vivian,</span><a href=#><span> relocated to Florida</span></a><span> after he solidified his move.</span></p><p>In February 2023, Tom announced his retirement from the sport in a video shared on Instagram.</p><p><span>“I’m retiring for good. I know the process was a pretty big deal last time,” he said in reference to his previous retirement announcement that was short-lived. “So, when I woke up this morning, I figured I’d just press record and let you guys know first so. I won’t be long-winded. You only get one super emotional retirement essay and I used mine up last year.”</span></p><h2><b>How Else Does Tom Brady Make Money?</b></h2><p><span>Though Tom was apprehensive about saying goodbye to his longtime Patriots teammates, he made quite a pretty penny in Tampa. The iconic athlete makes money in many different ways than just football, however.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In 2015, he authored his first book titled </span><i><span>Tom Brady</span></i><span>, followed by </span><i><span>The TB12 Method: How to Achieve a Lifetime of Sustained Peak Performance</span></i><span> in 2017. According to reports, Tom also has made more than $150 million from endorsements.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tpqZlkqeupcXSZqWerF2svLPAx2afqK9dosKktIympqedqWKxsLHSZquhnV2Wwam4xK2cZqWRoLJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
