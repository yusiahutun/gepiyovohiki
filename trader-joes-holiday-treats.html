Dark chocolate-covered peppermint Joe Joe's</h2><p>"Starting off with the classic, arguably the classic, the dark chocolate-covered peppermint Joe Joe's. They're a must for the holiday season," she said.</p><p>The Dark Chocolate Covered Peppermint Joe Joe's is a sandwich creme cookie with peppermint specs on the outer layer.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="read more trader joe's finds">read more trader joe's finds</h2><p>The whole cookie is encased in dark chocolate, and there are 10 pieces per box for $3.99.</p><p>One person commented: "Oooh my sister will love those Joes Joe's thanks!"</p><h2>2. Mini Hold The Cone peppermint flavor</h2><p>Trader Joe's Hold The Cone ice cream cones aren't necessarily new, but they come out with seasonal flavors.</p><p>Their all-year round flavors include vanilla, chocolate, and chocolate chip.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>But, Sarah's favorite flavor was back in stores for the holidays: "I love these peppermint-flavored Hold The Cones too."</p><p>They cost $3.79 for eight cones, and they're filled with rich peppermint-flavored ice cream with a sweet chocolatey coating.</p><h2>3. Ginger spread</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/40137d0a-a82b-4a94-9c73-f8011f39353d.jpg><p>Sarah mentioned: "I haven't tried this yet, but I'm excited to. I think this ginger spread would be great for charcuterie boards for the holidays."</p><p>Trader Joe’s Ginger Spread is a great addition to liven up your meals, and it's just $3.99</p><p>The spread was made in Dundee, Scotland, and its sweet and spicy flavor can give your yogurt or oatmeal a nice kick in the morning.</p><h2>4. Dark chocolate oranges</h2><p>"These dark chocolate oranges are like nostalgic to me, I love them."</p><p>Nothing is better than nostalgia during the holidays as it is the season to return home and spend it with loved ones.</p><p>Trader Joe’s Dark Chocolate Orange is a great gift, and it replicates the peeling of an actual orange since it's wrapped in orange foil.</p><p>They cost $3.49 each.</p><h2>5. Chocolate-covered Lebkuchen cookies</h2><p>The Lebkuchen Cookies are soft gingerbread cookies with nuts and spices.</p><p>Each box is $3.49, and there are seven cookies per package.</p><p>One person commented: "What is Lebkuchen?"</p><p>Sarah responded: "German cooookie."</p><h2>6. Sparkling pomegranate punch beverage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/seasonal-eats-xxx-trader-joe-779744389.jpg><p>The seasonal Sparkling Pomegranate Punch Beverage is a must-have.</p><p>The bubbly beverage is richly fruity with flavors like pomegranate, pineapple, orange, and apple juices with a kick of ginger.</p><p>"If you want to make festive cocktails easily, this pomegranate punch is your best friend," Sarah recommended.</p><p>One pack is $3.99, and it comes with four cans each.</p><h2>7. Egg nog</h2><p>"Eggnog is back and I couldn't be more excited. They also have the oat milk version which I really need to try."</p><p>What is Christmas without egg nog — it is a classic creamy beverage that began as a holiday tradition in North America in the 17th century.</p><p>Trader Joe's has a couple of varieties of egg nog — the original one is rich and flavorful, but they also have a Light Egg Nog.</p><p>The Light Egg Nog delivers the same creamy texture and nutmeg-infused flavor but with 90 percent less fat and 40 percent fewer calories.</p><p>They each cost $3.49.</p><h2>8. O’ Nog</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/seasonal-eats-xxx-trader-joe-779744395.jpg><p><a href=#>Trader Joe’s O’ Nog</a> is a new addition to the seasonal family.</p><p>The beverage is a non-dairy version of the egg nog, but it can still deliver the same creamy texture with its nutmeg and ginger flavors.</p><p>It is made with all vegan ingredients, and it's only $2.99.</p><h2>9. Stroopwafel Dutch caramel waffle cookies</h2><p>The Stroopwafel Dutch Caramel Waffle Cookies are back in stock again, but grab them before they are gone.</p><p>The cookies are definitely a staple of Trader Joe’s holiday lineup as people love the caramel flavor.</p><p>The waffle cookies are made by pressing waffles in a hot iron, and then quickly slicing those waffles in half while they’re still hot.</p><p>Lastly, they sandwich stretchy caramel in between each slice to form the cookie.</p><p>They're $3.49 for each can, but it's not in stores all year long, so better act quickly.</p><h2>10. Old Fashioned egg nog wine based</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/seasonal-eats-xxx-trader-joe-779744401.jpg><p>"This...I am interested in and a little suspicious of because I just didn't know how it would be," Sarah said.</p><p>This egg nog is for adults 21 years and up only, and again, it's only here during the holiday season.</p><p>The wine-based egg nog is a pre-mixed and ready-to-drink wine tail, and it costs $7.99.</p><h2>11. Brie en Croûte</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/seasonal-eats-xxx-trader-joe-779744398.jpg><p>"Lastly, this brie that is already wrapped in pastry, you just throw it in the oven, perfect for a holiday party," Sarah suggested.</p><p>Brie en Croûte translates to brie baked in a pastry crust, and after baking it, it has a delightful flaky finish.</p><p>The box of pastries comes frozen, and they're $6.99 per box.</p><h2>Other Trader Joe's finds</h2><p>Shoppers at Trader Joe's have new and returning items hitting the shelves.</p><p>There are&nbsp;<a href=#>five items&nbsp;</a>from&nbsp;Trader Joe's&nbsp;that are worth checking out — from soups to snacks, starting at $3.</p><p>First up, they have the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Autumnal Harvest Soup</a>, which is made with smooth butternut squash, semi-sweet pumpkin, and California tomatoes seasoned with earthy autumn herbs including rosemary and sage.</p><p>Take advantage of the fall season while it lasts because Trader Joe's&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pumpkin Bisque</a>&nbsp;is also here for a limited time.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Check out the new but old way&nbsp;<a href=#>Trader Joe's brought back</a>&nbsp;their shopping experience.</p><p>Read about a <a href=#>Trader Joe’s superfan's three most disliked items</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfa4VygJFramisopaxpr6Mo6aeq12dvK21w5qwZqyimq61v44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
