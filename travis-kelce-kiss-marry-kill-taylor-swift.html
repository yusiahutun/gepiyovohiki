And we know from the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/music/1624301/how-much-taylor-swift-tickets/>Eras Tour</a> seven years later, Taylor planted a good ol’ kiss for Travis as soon as she left the stage. Those celebrities aren’t the only ones that the interview asked Travis. Among the Kardashian sisters, he would choose to kill Khloe, marry Kim, and kiss Kylie—even though he can’t distinguish between them. (“What kind of game is this? This is torture!” he exclaimed in the middle of the game.)

According to a report, the “Lover” singer doesn’t want Kelce going to strip clubs anymore. A source told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Life & Style</a>&nbsp;that this is one Swift’s “hard rules” moving forward. Kelce, who has spoken about his outings to strip clubs on episodes of his “New Heights” podcast in the past, is apparently on board with the change. “Travis is fine with Taylor giving him her thoughts and opinions on how to navigate such a public relationship. He really does appreciate it,” the source told the outlet.</p><p>It’s a <a href=# data-type=link data-id=stylecaster.com/lists/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-relationship/>healthy standard</a> for relationships according to the source. “She doesn’t want to control him — just help. He’s under a microscope now, more than ever,” the source went on to add. “Taylor loves Travis and thinks these rules will help things with their romance, as well as his career, stay on the rails.” At the end of the day, the insider shared that “they’re both committed to doing whatever it takes to make their relationship stronger.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lmttbWphZMGzrdWiqmajlaGwpnnKoqqsZZ2Wv7PFjKSgpaRdqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
