Before, this would have meant sacrificing their ability to know who is sitting in their seats and how they got that ticket,” said Kirk Mortensen, Head of Product at True Tickets. “Giving our customers the convenience of Apple Wallet while still helping them build relationships with previously unknowable audience members and ensuring those patrons aren’t exploited by bad actors is a great achievement by our top-notch team of engineers.”</p><p>“We’re constantly striving to bring our technological expertise together with a deep understanding of our customers’ needs,” Mortensen continued. “This new Apple Wallet capability is just the latest example of how that approach allows us to innovatively solve problems with the ticketing experience for our clients and their patrons.”</p><p>“This step should further solidify True Tickets’ place in the ticketing industry by empowering venues with cutting-edge digital solutions,” he said. “To see this coupled technology solution become a reality is truly exciting, and I look forward to seeing how Smith Center patrons will be able to leverage it,” added Myron Martin, President and CEO of The Smith Center in Las Vegas.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4BwfJZoaW1npKfCpnnTopqknaSoeqK6zaisp5uVqHqqutOenquZpJ68r3nWoquhZZGlva2xjLCYpaSVqXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
