So what’s gone wrong?</p>In principle, any ambition for stronger UK economic growth would be commendable, but not when it is done with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">unfunded tax cuts</span></a>, when global interests rates and bond yields are pushing higher and with scant regard for market reaction. Recently announced <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">extra deficit spending</span></a> worth up to £150 billion (US$167.4 billion) to tackle the energy crisis was already hard for markets to swallow.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But announcing a further £45 billion of giveaway tax cuts in the mini-budget for the better-off and business was too much to stomach, especially when there was no attempt to quantify the impact on UK government finances, already groaning under the weight of the 2008 crash and the Covid-19 bailout. Casino economics and going for growth at any cost were hardly going to impress the markets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Truss’ vision for tax cuts, supply-side reforms and trickle-down economics was meant to unleash a new spirit of entrepreneurial zeal into the economy and lift growth potential to 2.5 per cent over the longer term, but it would be an uphill climb for the already battered UK.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/03/024fce28-3e1b-4052-be2c-20dba15fa600_34f54c2a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The trouble is that the world has seen it all before under Reaganomics in the early 1980s, when president Ronald Reagan’s neo-liberal programme of tax-cutting and supply-side reforms were in full swing and ended with dire consequences for US budget fundamentals and global financial stability.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Reagan’s supply-side formula was based on the now discredited Laffer curve assumption that lower tax rates would help reduce the budget deficit through higher growth – but, in fact, did the opposite. The Reagan administration began slashing marginal tax rates in 1981, exploding the US budget deficit and government debt to unsustainable levels in subsequent years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It took years of fiscal correction, mainly achieved through tough austerity cuts under Democrat president Bill Clinton, to bring the deficit back into line. Trussonomics will end up repeating history for the UK.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong may record its second worst deficit at over HK$100 billion: Paul Chan</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Markets hate uncertainty and the worst part for investors in UK financial assets is that they are having to fly blind into a vacuum on what the plan means for UK financial stability going forward.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the meantime, UK policy is going nowhere fast. The chancellor has his foot jammed on the fiscal accelerator for economic expansion, while the Bank of England is pressing hard on the monetary brake with higher interest rates. They are cancelling each other out.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, market sentiment has imploded. Some commentators reckon UK official interest rates could rise to 6 per cent next year from 2.25 per cent at the moment, with all that means for higher mortgage rates and weaker consumer confidence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Thirty-year UK government bond yields jumped from 3.5 per cent to 5 per cent in the space of a few trading sessions after the mini-budget, while the pound collapsed to close to an all-time low, near to parity with the US dollar.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Markets took a dim view of Britain potentially slipping into a doom loop of ever-higher interest rates and an ever-lower pound. With sterling in bargain basement territory, corporate Britain is up for sale. Credit rating agencies are circling for a possible UK sovereign debt downgrade.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Conservatives’ plan to jump-start UK growth is doomed to failure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">David Brown is the chief executive of New View Economics</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC5zJ6lrWefpbavtc6nZpqqpJ6wrbGObGhybGZnhnDA0a6qrGWgoa6vecmupKllo6mus8CMrqJmn6KkxLW0jKucoZmjnbavs4yrnJqfkaO8rrXCrGSwmaNirq3DwLKq</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
