As we thank the angel of a woman that carried our miracle baby boy for us, we pray for everyone who struggles to reach this joyous milestone. York Banks Asla, welcome to the world.”</span></p><p><span>Two years after Tyra and the Norwegian photographer — who dated for four years before</span><a href=#> <span>splitting in October 2017</span></a><span> — welcomed their little one, the proud mama opened up about</span><a href=#> <span>turning to in vitro fertilization</span></a><span>. Tyra said it was an “emotional” road to motherhood as the two tried “for a while” to have kids.</span></p><p><span>“There are so many stages,” the </span><i><span>Tyra Banks Show</span></i><span> creator explained to</span><a href=#><i><span> People</span></i></a><span> in March 2018 of the difficult IVF process. “It’s like, ‘OK, it’s a healthy embryo. OK, it’s month one.’ I was just constantly living on edge until I held him for the first time.”</span></p><p><span>The following month in April 2018, Tyra revealed she wasn’t sure if having more kids was in the cards even though she always “[wanted] three” children. She noted she “unfortunately [doesn’t] have embryos frozen” while chatting with</span><a href=#> <i><span>ET</span></i></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>“I think I’m lucky, you know, I did [IVF] for about a year and a half and some women do it for years and years and years,” she explained. “I think that was the end [though]. I think I probably could’ve kept going, but I just think it wasn’t healthy for my body because less eggs and less eggs and less eggs, you know, every month.”</span></p><p><span>Despite her former dreams of having a big family, Tyra insisted she was so grateful to be the mom of her adorable son. “I’m so happy,” she gushed to the outlet.</span></p><p><b>Scroll down below to learn more about Tyra’s son, York.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tsKuZXZeur7fSZqKinKNitKbAjK2mZqOepMRuwMeeZK2uXZ28tMDSZqanpKliwLC6jLKmq6Nf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
