Former light heavyweight title challenger Smith had talked big before the fight about hunting down Jon Jones for the belt again, but he now faces a huge battle to bounce back from a devastating defeat."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The 31-year-old looked defeated on his stool after the fourth round, complaining that “my teeth are falling out” – he had just casually handed some to Herzog a couple of minutes earlier, while taking shots on the ground. His team’s response? “All the fights we’ve had, we’re not losing this one.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Former light heavyweight title challenger Smith had talked big before the fight about hunting down Jon Jones for the belt again, but he now faces a huge battle to bounce back from a devastating defeat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the No 8-ranked Teixeira, it was a huge step towards getting another crack himself at the 205-pound champion Jones. The UFC veteran is likely to rise high in the rankings next after the impressive victory over No 4 Smith.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/05/14/ce3ccc7c-959d-11ea-ae0d-0e69ba128e68_972x_135018.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It's not how hard you hit, it’s how hard you get hit and keep coming forward, that's what it's about, baby,” Teixeira said in his post-fight interview with former light heavyweight and heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier in the Octagon.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You're one of the guys [that's showing how it's done at this age],” he added. “But I love the challenge. You, Yoel Romero, those guys, keep fighting on the top. [I’m] going on another run for that title.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The first round was briefly paused by Herzog after an inadvertent groin strike by Teixeira, who had caught Smith’s attention with a flurry of strikes against the fence which would set the tone for the rest of the fight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/05/14/acb91a24-959d-11ea-ae0d-0e69ba128e68_972x_135018.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Teixeira had Smith in trouble with a big combination of strikes in the second round but Smith saved himself with some smart head movement, and continued to repel his advancing opponent with front leg kicks to the body.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The fight then turned in the third round when Teixeira knocked Smith down with a clean shot. He tried to take the back, then got into side mount as he looked for Smith’s neck.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Smith could only cover up and try to hold his opponent’s arms as Teixeira suffocated him with pressure, alternating between ground and pound and submission attempts for a good three minutes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/05/14/c0401b1a-959d-11ea-ae0d-0e69ba128e68_972x_135018.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Smith continued to show amazing resilience but Herzog was giving him a long leash while Teixeira remained patient and relaxed looking for the finish.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Smith managed to survive to the buzzer but Teixeira came straight out and rocked him again in round four. Smith started throwing elbows but Teixeira kept landing and got it to the ground again after Smith shot for a desperate single leg.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The rest of the round played out almost exactly the same as the third, with Smith just trying to hang on. Smith looked finished heading into the final round, with nothing left on the feet, and shot for a takedown again. Teixeira quickly took control on the ground once more before another flurry of strikes finally convinced Herzog to step in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/05/14/b18ca11a-959d-11ea-ae0d-0e69ba128e68_972x_135018.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Teixeira helped a disconsolate Smith up to his feet afterwards and consoled him against the fence, before heading over to see a casually dressed UFC president Dana White.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Did I get the performance of the night?” he asked. It was hard to deny him, and he did indeed get the extra us$50,000, along with Drew Dober, who got an impressive TKO against Alexander Hernandez earlier in the night.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I go there believing it, win it or die, that’s what I do. I’m putting my heart on the line, my faith on the line, everything on the line, that’s what I do,” Teixeira added backstage.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Help us understand what you are interested in so that we can improve SCMP and provide a better experience for you.
