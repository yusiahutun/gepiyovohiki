The first prototypes of the Typhon were delivered to the US Army in November 2022.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is limited data available about Typhon and I expect this is part of the ongoing development process, to get it in-theatre to see how it performs,” said Garren Mulloy, an international-relations professor at Japan’s Daito Bunka University and a specialist in military issues.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“New systems generally perform well on test ranges in deserts in the US, where they are not affected by the maritime climate, the high humidity of the Asia-Pacific region,” he pointed out. “The US army is going to want to see how it performs in more testing conditions and to start training the units that will operate it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/08/b638fc79-8232-4909-a343-738b8ab75264_f87d3ba6.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Initial reports that the US was preparing to station its new mid-range capability launcher in the region first emerged in November last year, when General Charles Flynn, the US Army Pacific’s commanding general, said at the Halifax International Security Forum that two Typhon batteries had been completed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In 2024, we intend to deploy that system in the region,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Flynn reiterated that commitment in an interview with Japanese media in Tokyo on Wednesday last week, but did not reveal a timeline.</p>The Asahi newspaper quoted a US government source on Thursday, confirming it to be the Typhon and that batteries will initially be based in Guam, with deployment to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Japan</span></a> for training.To justify the deployment, the US can use North Korean leader <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Kim Jong-un</span></a>’s threats to attack US military facilities on Guam and similar bellicose statements against Japan, a close ally of Washington, Mulloy said, although Pyongyang is not the real cause of concern.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In the past, Japan has been in line with the US to address ‘the North Korean threat’ because it’s easy to identify that threat,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But the subtext here is that they are really talking about China,” he added. “North Korea is easy to identify as an enemy because it’s basically a James Bond-villain state, but the reality is that there is a much more complex and nuanced threat that is both military and economic coming from China.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Typhon unit consists of a mobile operations centre, up to four autonomous mobile launchers, reload trailers and a support vehicle. The launchers are designed to fire either the Standard Missile 6, which can target enemy aircraft or inbound missiles and function as a high-speed anti-shipping weapon, or the Tomahawk cruise missile.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Fearing China’s rise, Japan coughs up US$2.9 billion for long-range missiles</span></p></a></h3>The Tomahawk has a range of 1,600km (994 miles), which places it between the US’ Precision Strike Missile that has a range of around 805km (500 miles) and the long-range <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">hypersonic weapon</span></a> that went into service last year and has a range of nearly 2,800km (1,740 miles).The deployment of a capable new weapons system in the Western Pacific is unlikely to be ignored by Washington’s rivals in the region, with China, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Russia</span></a> and North Korea all likely to express fears of an intensifying arms race in the region, Mulloy said.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Deployment might be tricky in terms of arms control treaties that have been signed,” he said. “There are various Cold War treaties that cover the deployment of missile systems and while some have lapsed or been effectively abandoned, there are some who will argue that bringing Typhon into the Asia-Pacific region will be in breach of a treaty.”</p>And while the system may be designed to keep China at bay, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Russia</span></a> is “obviously not far away and Moscow is extremely sensitive about any military technology that comes into ‘their area’, and that includes Japan”, he said.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2wuMitoJyrX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2JqhXN%2FkmisrGWUmr2tu9hmpZ6vXaK2pXnRmqWgnV2itrS%2FyKWcZqupqMGmuYyaqqKZXaWupLXFoppmnZ6ZerqxwKtkraegYrSmusSrmKVlo5bGtA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
