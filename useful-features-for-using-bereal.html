Whether you’re just starting out on the app or are an everyday user, here are some useful features that help you get the most out of BeReal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=realmojis>1. Realmojis</h2><p>Realmojis are the reactions you can make to another user’s BeReal post. These are similar to the “like” or “favorite” buttons (though some argue that <a href=#>likes have ruined other social media platforms</a>).</p><p>To start, tap the smiley face icon in the bottom-right corner of a BeReal post that you want to leave a Realmoji on. Then, choose one of two options.</p><p>The first option allows you to choose an <strong>emoji icon</strong> on the row that appears, then capture an image of yourself imitating that emoji to use as your Realmoji. This image will save as that Realmoji. You can now use your new Realmoji to react to any BeReal post by just tapping it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bereal-post-on-home-feed.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bereal-realmoji-options.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bereal-taking-a-realmoji.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bereal-saving-a-realmoji.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bereal-realmoji-on-friend-s-post.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Option two is the Instant Realmoji. After tapping the <strong>smiley face icon</strong> on a BeReal post, tap the <strong>lightning bolt icon</strong>. This will take an instant photo of you at that moment to use as a Realmoji on that BeReal post. Instant Realmojis will not save for re-use.</p><p>You may notice little circle icons lined up in the bottom left corner of users’ BeReal posts or on the bottom of your own. These are other people’s Realmojis. Tap them to see a menu with them larger on the screen.</p><h2 id=the-bereal-map>2. The BeReal Map</h2><p>You may not have noticed the location and time listed under the user's name on their BeReal post, even if you have been using the app for a while. Tapping them offers a few great features though, including the app's built-in map.</p><p>Tap either the location or time stamp and more information about that BeReal post will come up. Tap the location again to see where that BeReal was taken on a map.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Your own location is shown with a blue dot, and a small circle with the person's BeReal displays their location when they took it. This is similar to <a href=#>using the Snap Map on Snapchat</a>, so if you are familiar with that feature, you will find the BeReal map easy to use. It is different, however, because the BeReal map does not show a live location, and you can only see the location of the specific post you were looking at, not everyone's at the same time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bereal-home-feed.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewing-a-bereal-post.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewing-the-bereal-map.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span><h2 id=bereal-retakes>3. BeReal Retakes</h2><p>BeReal also keeps track of how many times someone retook their photo before posting it to the app. You can see this information also by tapping the <strong>location or time stamp</strong> on a post. If there is no retake information on this screen, then no retakes were taken.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This will help you know who is actually being real and who is trying to get that perfect picture. This feature is one of the ways BeReal is truly differentiating itself from other platforms, since it's easy to feel like <a href=#>social media sites are becoming the same</a>.</p><h2 id=memories>4. Memories</h2><p>Do you know what happens to your old BeReal posts once the new one comes along? They get stored in your Memories!</p><p>To access these from the home page, go to your profile by tapping your profile picture at the top right of the screen. BeReal shows you the last 14 days of Memories here on your profile screen. To see all of your memories, tap <strong>View all my Memories</strong>. Now, you can scroll back in time and see each day you posted a BeReal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BeReal-Screenshot_Profile-screen.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BeReal-Screenshot_View-All-Memories-Screen.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can also delete your Memories in the settings on the app.</p><h2 id=the-friends-of-friends-tab>5. The Friends of Friends Tab</h2><p>You may have noticed that BeReal has two feeds: My Friends and Friends of Friends. The Friends of Friends tab lets you see BeReal posts from users that your friends are friends with. The idea is that you can find people you know to add as a friend on the app. If you want to post for users to see on the Friends of Friends tab, tap <strong>your BeReal</strong> after posting it, then tap the <strong>three dots icon</strong> in the top right corner of the screen.</p><p>Select <strong>Change Audience</strong> and you can switch between <strong>My Friends Only </strong>or <strong>My friends + their friends.</strong></p><h2 id=pins>6. Pins<img alt="BeReal logo on smartphone screen" data-image-id=776513 height=840 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/take-screenshot-bereal.jpg width=1680 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><p>Did you know that you can pin your favorite memories on your BeReal profile? Just tap your <strong>profile picture</strong> in the top right, then tap the <strong>plus icon </strong>under <strong>Pins</strong>. You can pick any old BeReal post from your Memories to add. And, you can add up to three pins on your profile.</p><p>Your friends can see your pins when they visit your profile.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bonus-bereal>7. Bonus BeReal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/take-screenshot-bereal.jpg><p>If you take your BeReal and post it on time, the app will let you <a href=#>post multiple times on BeReal using Bonus BeReal</a>. This is an especially useful feature if you are doing something fun later that day, so you can take your regular BeReal on time, then post again when you are doing that fun activity.</p><p>It also just allows users to share more of their real authentic lives, and it is a great incentive to post on time.</p><h2 id=connect-your-spotify-or-apple-music-to-your-bereal-account>8. Connect Your Spotify or Apple Music to Your BeReal Account</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can also <a href=#>connect your favorite music streaming platform to BeReal</a> to share what you are listening to when you post that day. The song will appear below your post on your friends' feeds. It only appears if you are listening to music on your connected streaming platform at the time when you take your BeReal.</p><p>You cannot add a song to your post later. Music posted with your BeReal will not save to your Memories with the post.</p><h2></h2><h2 id=get-more-out-of-bereal>Get More Out of BeReal</h2><p>With these additional features, you can get more out of using BeReal than just taking a picture every day. The new social media has millions of downloads, so you’ll be ready to be part of the craze!</p><p>Make sure to explore the app's settings and different tabs to discover additional features that you can use.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGisrJ2WqrlussSaq66qlah6p7vRZqysoZ6ceqOx0Z6YpWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
