"Stassi was always very kind to me, but I definitely did hear a lot of rumors about things she said and comments she's made, so I was nervous going in for sure, but I wanted to speak my truth, and she has a platform."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7547e8ac-1a27-5964-8424-fbc33ff695d2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0cc9b09b-99cc-5086-9e75-50d42a706a90 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fe/5by4/2018/02/05/fe71569c5d0953489318a2d7e384a214_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Vanderpump Rules' SURver Scuffle: Ariana Comes For Stassi -- 'This Bitch Actually Takes Pride in Being Ignorant'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Billie says Ariana is "very educated on LGBT issues," so she understands why she "gets so frustrated when someone who has such a privileged background says ignorant things."</p><p>Still, Billie says she sympathizes with Stassi because she, too, has said ignorant things.</p><p>"I don't necessarily know about other cultures or other people," she explained.

"Her thing was that she was tired of people using their platforms at award shows to tell their story. She was saying that was annoying and whiny. For me, anytime someone can get a platform to educate someone on issues, I think that's really important. I don't consider it whining at all."</p><p>"Vanderpump Rules" airs Mondays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.</p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b6/o/2017/06/12/b646560ba3cd5aab872b394a3fd78edc_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Social Media</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7j2tmanFfq66vsMSrp66loGK%2FtrjErGSboZyhtqZ5y56cZquklsC0tYysmqGqn5qxpr6Mqaadm5GowW6%2F06uYop%2BYqXq2vIywoK2gXajBor%2FSomSaqpmWu6J506uYp6uXmrulsdFmqZqbmai6cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
