The </span><span><i>Vanderpump Rules </i>cast</span><span>&nbsp;talked&nbsp;</span><span><b>Kristen Doute</b>’s&nbsp;</span><span>“fake” apologies and&nbsp;</span><span><b>Mike Shay</b>’s&nbsp;</span><span>addictions in part 1 of the Bravo series’ season 4 reunion on Monday, March 21. After <b>Andy Cohen</b>&nbsp;</span><span>greeted everyone individually — especially the women showing off their cleavage — the group jumped right into all of the breakups and makeups that happened this season.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“If you look at this group, all of them — at some time — hate each other,”&nbsp;</span><span><b>Lisa Vanderpump</b>&nbsp;</span><span>said, and she was so right.</span></p><p><b>James Is So Over Kristen&nbsp;</b></p><p>It’s no secret that one of the biggest feuds in the show is between&nbsp;<span><b>Jax Taylor</b>&nbsp;</span><span>and&nbsp;</span><span><b>James Kennedy</b>.&nbsp;</span><span>Jax said he thinks James has a nasty mouth, and James loves to egg him on, especially since Jax is on probation and cannot get into any further trouble. He even told James he’d love to hit him “so bad,” but he can’t. James better watch out for when Jax gets off probation&nbsp;</span><span>because all hell will probably break loose.</span></p><p><span>James and Kristen discussed their rocky history as they both accused each other of cheating for the millionth time. She recalled how James used her to get everything when they were together, including a spot on the show. “Hey, there’s a reason I’m dating a cougar,” James responded and referred to Kristen as a “sugar mama.” It doesn’t look like James has any intention of getting on Kristen’s good side, and if he does, he’s doing it very badly.</span></p><span class=caption></span><p><span><b>Kristen Goes on the Defensive</b></span></p><p><span>The cast recalled the long path of Kristen’s “apology train” after&nbsp;</span><span>she got kicked out of Sur and went to a counselor to try to put her life back together. Her ex-boyfriend&nbsp;</span><span><b>Tom Sandoval</b>&nbsp;</span><span>accused Kristen of only apologizing to <b>Ariana Madix</b>&nbsp;</span><span>after she freaked out about Ariana and Tom’s romance in order to get invited on their trip to Hawaii.</span></p><p><span>“There were things that I knew I needed to own up to,” Kristen&nbsp;</span><span>said. She claimed her apologizes to everyone were real, but virtually everyone in the group aside from Katie accused her of only apologizing as a “desperate attempt” to fix her friendships. “I can’t wait until she breaks your heart again, because it’s going&nbsp;</span><span>to happen,” James said to Katie about Kristen.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nup_172471_0031_jax-taylor-kristen-doute-katie-maloney-tom-schwartz-vanderpump-rules-zoom-afdafb79-180f-4598-b65a-1e5f4e1fcaec.jpg><p><b>Mike Gets Clean!</b></p><p>Mike Shay made his first reunion appearance to address his previous addiction problem. After returning home to his parents’ house to get his act together (*cough cough* get away from <b>Scheana Shay</b>), he cleaned up his act. Scheana admitted that at first, she didn’t think her husband’s habit was such a big problem because she had no knowledge of addiction.</p><p><span>However, Mike admitted that after he started taking Vicodin for a sports-related injury, he was taking around five to six pills a day. “I thought it was something that would pass quickly and something no one would even need to know,” Scheana said.</span></p><p>The Sur server was very wrong and needed the support of her friends when she received massive criticism online and from Tom Sandoval for encouraging Mike to still drink but just in moderation. Scheana was crying heavily but claimed she has “bettered herself so much” because she is more educated about addiction after having lived through it.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nup_172471_0068_ariana-madix-lala-kent-tom-sandoval-james-kennedy-scheana-marie-vanderpump-rules-andy-cohen-zoom-ad5cb159-bcf9-4cd7-a9b2-fdc80673666c.jpg><p>Mike didn’t blame her either, since he caused the problem and is “100 percent at fault.” He is now completely off pills and hasn’t had a drink in three months. “I had to choose Scheana or choose drugs,” he emotionally said and added that if it wasn’t for his wife, he’d probably still be addicted to substances.</p><p><b>Lala Sticks by Her Story</b></p><p><b>Lala Kent </b>has felt a disconnect from a lot of people at Sur ever since she got a job there. “It’s intimidating coming into a group like this,” the Sur host said. She didn’t exactly start out on the right foot when she lied to Lisa by saying she was a model and had to travel, when really men were paying for her to go on expensive vacations. She claimed she’s never slept with any of the men who have sent her to exotic places but added she’s “lost count” of how many times it has happened.</p><p>“If I were sleeping with one of them, I would wear it with pride,” Lala said. Her castmates didn’t appear convinced by her story, though, and who could blame them? Lala doesn’t exactly have a perfect track record.</p><p>Tell <i>Us:</i> Were Kristen’s costars right to be so hard on her?</p><p><i>Vanderpump Rules</i> airs on Bravo on Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK2appSav7HBzKlkq62cmsBuv8SaqqimXWl6s7HUp6Copl2gv6q%2F056lZpyVm7KvsNJmn56qo5q5p3nWanBya2RufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
