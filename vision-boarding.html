High-profile names such as Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon credit the visualisation technique for helping make their dreams become reality – in which case, the results speak for themselves.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But what exactly does it involve? Just as the name suggests, a vision board is all about painting a picture of the imagined success of your future self. Whether you're aiming for a new job, a loving relationship, or to master a particular skill, putting your intentions down on paper can be a highly motivating way to help you achieve it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actual vision board can look different for everyone – its form depends on your own personal preferences for retaining information. It might be a handwritten list of different goals or a collage of images that you find inspiring. It's not to be confused with a mood board, which acts more as a source of inspiration for a one-off project, rather than to help you achieve specific goals or ambitions you've set yourself.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Natalie Portman: How I Got Here" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/hbz-high-np-thumbnail-1-65842db1c83fd.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To help you get started and build your own vision board for 2024 and beyond, we’ve enlisted the experts to share how they create theirs, the science behind the technique and how to make it work for you.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How does vision boarding actually work?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To put it most simply, it's a psychological technique. Creating a vision board helps to activate the brain's neural networks and is particularly effective for realising intentions because, if done properly, the brain interprets the board as a real experience, thanks to sensory perception, emotion and motor planning.</p><img alt="seven year cycle work stress and mindfullness" title="Seven year cycle - work stress and mindfullness" width=6247 height=4998 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/stress-work-mind-1657718677.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Visualisation is considered a powerful tool for the brain, because it engages various cognitive processes and can have a significant impact on motivation, goal-setting, and overall mental wellbeing,” explains Dr Jenna Vyas-Lee, clinical psychologist and co-founder of mental healthcare clinic <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://koveminds.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Kove class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Kove</a>. “While the term ‘vision boarding’ is often associated with a specific technique, the underlying principles draw on the science of visualisation and positive psychology. The bottom line is that visualisation, including vision boarding, can be a powerful tool to shape attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours, ultimately influencing the path to achieving personal and professional goals.”</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Creating your vision board</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Your vision board can look however you want; after all, it’s designed purely to help you achieve your personal goals. Set the mood by carving out plenty of time in your schedule to get immersed in the process. Many experts suggest lighting some candles or putting on some calming music – whatever you feel you need to be relaxed and comfortable.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“A vision board is a visual representation of what you want your life to look like,” notes <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/mind-body/a46184879/new-year-reset-tips/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Roxie Nafousi" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Roxie Nafousi</a>, the self-development coach and author of the bestselling <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Manifest-Sunday-Times-bestseller-change/dp/0241539595 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Manifest: 7 Steps to Living Your Best Life" data-vars-ga-product-id=d337de97-bd5c-4e04-a320-d8ee0b22abae data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Manifest-Sunday-Times-bestseller-change/dp/0241539595 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Manifest-Sunday-Times-bestseller-change/dp/0241539595 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Manifest-Sunday-Times-bestseller-change/dp/0241539595 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"ae33d438-478d-4444-8c90-a5755782a57c","site_id":"73f36449-646d-480d-bdba-369f484c6984","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand=amazon.co.uk data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=30e295e6-d6aa-410c-b004-eaacd1810d70 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=amazon.co.uk class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Manifest: 7 Steps to Living Your Best Life</a>. “It should have extremely specific and detailed goals on it.

Keep an eye out for things that evoke emotions you want to feel in your life, or words that represent what you want your life to look like. I like to cut out and stick all these things together physically, but you can do vision boards digitally, too.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In her book, Nafousi suggests that, before you start adding to your board, you take a moment to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/mind-body/a46184879/new-year-reset-tips/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=reflect class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">reflect</a> on how you feel and really imagine who you want your future self to be in a few months, a year or even five years. Don't hold back; dream big and approach the process with no limitations. She then suggests splitting your life into six categories, and then writing down all the things you want to manifest within it:</p><ul data-node-id=17 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>Personal development (i.e. your personal growth/how you want to feel)</li><li>Love and romance</li><li>Career</li><li>Friends and family</li><li>House/home</li><li>Hobbies/leisure</li></ul><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How often do you update it?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now that your vision has come together in one place – with your goals and aspirations clearly stated – what do you do next? Well, the beauty of vision boarding is you can add to it as you progress, but there's also no pressure to do so. "I personally don’t [add], but there are no rules," says Nafousi. "If you want to go back and cross something off and add something new, then you can do that. Or you can always make a new one; you could make a new 6-month vision board halfway through the year."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gallagher adds: "It may be worth reviewing your board every quarter, solstice or equinox to make sure it's still aligned with who you are and where you want to go. We as humans should be constantly changing and evolving, so it’s OK that our dreams and goals change too."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But, she warns, resist temptation to change your board too often. “This can be a sneaky form of sabotage, as constantly changing the goalposts means you will never actually achieve anything. If you do find yourself doing this, check in as to whether there are any deep-rooted doubts or fears around having what you want."</p><img alt="lip, hairstyle, skin, shoulder, water, summer, elbow, jaw, beauty, chest," title="Lip, Hairstyle, Skin, Shoulder, Water, Summer, Elbow, Jaw, Beauty, Chest, " width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/16/03/1453145068-yoga.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Yu Tsai for Harper's Bazaar UK</span></p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">When should I look at my vision board?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As the premise of a vision board is specific to you, its effectiveness varies from person to person. Depending on your preferences, daily routine or specific goals, there are benefits to looking at your vision board in the morning and evening – or, never at all.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Some people find that looking at their vision board in the morning helps set a positive tone for the day," notes Dr Vyas-Lee. "The morning may be a motivating time to review goals and intentions, and visualising success at that time may result in a more optimistic outlook and better preparation for the challenges of the day ahead."</p><img alt="intention setting" title="Intention setting" width=667 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/18-03-29-town-country-shot8-091-d-preview-1642089046.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Agata Pospieszynska for Harper's Bazaar</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That said, referencing your vision board in the evening holds just as many benefits. "Evening might be the perfect time for reflection and relaxation," adds Dr Vyas-Lee. "Reviewing before bed can offer a moment of introspection and allow individuals to unwind while focusing on their long-term goals. Some believe that the brain continues to process information during sleep, so viewing a vision board before bedtime may allow the subconscious mind to work on the visualised goals overnight."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Alternatively, it might help you to put your vision board away and not look at it all until the chosen date you wanted to achieve your goals by. This is Nafousi's personal preference and says that it's something she gets asked about a lot. "To manifest anything into your life you need to know what you want (be clear in your vision) and then you need to surrender to the journey that will lead you there," she writes in Manifest.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She acknowledges that other experts in the field suggest keeping your board somewhere prominent and checking it consistently, and that "the conflicting advice can be confusing". "Let me first say that there is a good argument for both sides and I am certainly not trying to say my way is the only way," she adds. "You should decide what feels best for you."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The best way to figure out what works for you is to try it out. "Ultimately, the most effective time to look at a vision board is the time that aligns with your personal preferences and daily routine," says Dr Vyas-Lee. "Experiment and see what you find most impactful."</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What happens next?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Once you’re happy with your vision board, it’s important to always keep it at the forefront of your mind or somewhere you can easily access it (if you want to) when you feel you need a bit of guidance. But, perhaps most importantly, imagine that everything on there is already happening.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Really imagine how your vision board would feel as a reality," says Gallagher. "Look at your board and visualise that these things have already happened. The purpose of a vision board is to help motivate and inspire you to go after what you want, so the more time you spend on it, the more you’ll feel it’s possible to make it your reality."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX6K2r7CMm6adsV%2BWgXd%2BlW5wbWpfq7a0tc6nZJunkaexqrrGaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
