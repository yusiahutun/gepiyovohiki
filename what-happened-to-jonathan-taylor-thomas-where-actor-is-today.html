The 1994 film was just one of the many credits added to his resume in his early teen years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>At the age of 17, the </span><i><span>Ally McBeal</span></i><span> alum decided to embark on a new chapter in his life and ended his run as a main cast member on </span><i><span>Home Improvement</span></i><span>. He attended Harvard University and later St. Andrew’s University in Scotland. Jonathan did not return to reprise his role in the show’s series finale in 1999 due to his academic obligations. He left Harvard in 2002 but returned to the Ivy League sector to </span><span>earn his bachelor’s degree </span><span>at </span><span>Columbia University in 2010.

I’m just Jonathan. I don’t like hanging out with other actors and actresses.”</span></p><p><span>In the years following his run on </span><i><span>Home Improvement</span></i><span>, Jonathan appeared in the 1999 film </span><i><span>Speedway Junky</span></i><span> and later voiced the character Tyler Tucker in </span><i><span>The Wild Thornberrys</span></i><span> from 2000 to 2001.

While it is uncertain if Jonathan will ever return to acting, he reflected on rising to fame at a young age in a March 2013 interview with </span><a href=#><i><span>People</span></i></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>“I never took the fame too seriously,” he said. “It was a great period in my life, but it doesn’t define me.
