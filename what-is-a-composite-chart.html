Relationship Astrology, Explained</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-03-13</div><p class=p1>Like most astrologers and astro-lovers, I always enjoy trying to understand my relationships through a cosmic lens. The beauty of <a href=# id=auto-tag_astrology data-tag=astrology>astrology</a> is that it can tell you everything you need to know about a <a href=# id=auto-tag_relationship data-tag=relationship>relationship</a>, such as why I may experience communication issues with someone or how someone may perceive me. If you’re wondering how to get to the core of how a relationship functions, you’ll first need to learn <a href=#>what a composite chart is</a>.</p><p class=p1>When my interest in astrology first began, I had primarily used <a href=#>a method called “synastry”</a> as a means of gauging my <a href=# id=auto-tag_compatibility data-tag=compatibility>compatibility</a> with others, but it only offered a glimpse into the way two people could work together based on the way each of their planetary placements&nbsp; interact with one another. Although <a href=# id=auto-tag_synastry data-tag=synastry>synastry</a> has incredible merit, I felt like I was missing something integral that will help me better understand the astrology behind a relationship. For years, I wondered if there was an astrological chart that captures <a href=#>the relationship as a whole</a>; as though the relationship was a unit in and of itself.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/newmoonintauruszodiac.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1"><p class=p1>In my quest to better understand how a relationship could function using the application of astrology to explain the nuances of my relationships, I came across something called a “<a href=# id=auto-tag_composite-chart data-tag=composite-chart>composite chart</a>”. Unlike synastry, composite charts offer a more meaningful look into a relationship instead of comparing how two individuals work together. By adopting this method in my astro-analysis, I realized that composite charts were the key to having a well-rounded view of what a relationship entailed <a href=#>from an astrological perspective</a>.</p><p>Because calculating and understanding how to analyze a composite chart can see intimidating at first, it’s actually a lot easier than it looks. Here’s everything you need to know about composite charts and how they can shed light on whether or not two people are truly compatible:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/astro.jpg><h2>What Is a Composite Chart?</h2><p class=p3>Before we dive into what a composite chart is, you will need the following information to compute your composite chart – dates of birth (mm/dd/yyyy), <a href=#>exact birth times including AM/PM</a>, and birthplaces for both individuals. Keep in mind that having accurate information is necessary to calculate any chart! Plus, you can compute a composite chart for any type of relationship. Calculate your composite chart on <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s1>Astro Charts</span></a> or <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s1>AstroSeek</span></a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3>A composite chart is the result of two birth charts added together to find the mathematical midpoint between each placement. It may sound initially confusing, but it’s essentially averaging the median point between each placement in the two individual charts to compose the composite chart. For example, if <a href=# id=auto-tag_birth-chart data-tag=birth-chart>birth chart</a> A has an Aries sun and birth chart B has a Gemini sun, then the midpoint would likely be a Taurus sun, which would become the sun sign for the composite chart.</p><p class=p3>This process is repeated for each planetary placement, such as <a href=#>planets, houses, aspects and more</a>. Given that the composite chart is a compilation of mathematical midpoints, there will not be any retrogrades recorded in the composite chart. So, natal retrogrades in an individual’s birth chart will not translate to the calculation of the composite chart. Once you have calculated the composite chart, you might be surprised that it looks just like a birth chart. But looks are deceiving, so you will find that the composite chart reads a little differently from a birth chart!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/February-Horoscopes.gif?w=670"><h2 class=p3>How to Read a Composite Chart</h2><p class=p3>Similar to a birth chart, the composite chart will have twelve houses, aspects and planets. Unlike a birth chart, the composite chart placements will represent the relationship, not the individuals. This will mean that the significance of the placements will change ever so slightly to accommodate for the astrological expression of a relationship.</p><p class=p3>The planets will represent the relationship’s personality, so this is the result of combining two individuals’ personalities to create the relationship’s personality. Likewise, the twelve houses will represent how the relationship handles and receives each area of life, so this is the result of two individual lives coming together to create one. So, the composite chart’s planetary placements and houses <a href=#>should be read as the following</a>:</p><ul class=ul1><li class=li3>Composite sun: the relationship’s ego, vitality, identity and core focus</li><li class=li3>Composite moon: the relationship’s emotional expression and intuition<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></li><li class=li3>Composite Mercury: the relationship’s mental processing and communication style</li><li class=li3>Composite Venus: the relationship’s <a href=# id=auto-tag_love data-tag=love>love</a> language(s), relationship/commitment style, aesthetic and financial mindset</li><li class=li3>Composite Mars: the relationship’s ambition, drive, sexual energy and fighting style</li><li class=li3>Composite Jupiter: the relationship’s journey, luck and abundance</li><li class=li3>Composite Saturn: the relationship’s restrictions, boundaries and karmic lessons</li><li class=li3>Composite Uranus: the relationship’s innovation, uniqueness and instability</li><li class=li3>Composite Neptune: the relationship’s escapism, fantasy and spiritual essence</li><li class=li3>Composite Pluto: the relationship’s transformation, power dynamics and control dynamics</li><li class=li3>Composite 1st House: the relationship’s identity, appearance and first impression<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></li><li class=li3>Composite 2nd House: the relationship’s values, security and financial opportunities<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></li><li class=li3>Composite 3rd House: the relationship’s opportunity for local travel, communication and local environment</li><li class=li3>Composite 4th House: the relationship’s roots, home and family</li><li class=li3>Composite 5th House: the relationship’s pleasurable pastimes, self-expression, romance, <a href=# id=auto-tag_sex data-tag=sex>sex</a>-life and response to pregnancy/children</li><li class=li3>Composite 6th House: the relationship’s daily routine, service to one another and response to work/health</li><li class=li3>Composite 7th House: the relationship’s martial/commitment status and contracts<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></li><li class=li3>Composite 8th House: the relationship’s intimacy, secrets, assets, investments and debts</li><li class=li3>Composite 9th House: the relationship’s belief systems, opportunities for long-distance travel and exploration</li><li class=li3>Composite 10th House: the relationship’s status, legacy, accomplishments and responses to career</li><li class=li3>Composite 11th House: the relationship’s hopes, wishes, dreams, friendships and community</li><li class=li3>Composite 12th House: the relationship’s subconscious, hidden talents and hidden weaknesses</li></ul><p class=p3>Ideally, the main planetary factors to focus on for a composite chart would be the <a href=#>sun, moon, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn</a>. The sun and moon will speak to the strength, ego, and emotional regulation within the relationship. Then Venus and Jupiter may represent the aspects of the relationship that come easily or function well whereas Mars and Saturn may represent shared difficulties in the relationship. Typically, the 1st and 7th Houses will be the most important since this refers to the relationship’s identity and commitment. However, a romantic composite chart may also find the 2nd, 5th and 8th houses to be just as important. A platonic or familial composite chart may focus more on the 3rd, 6th, and 11th houses.</p><p class=p3>Although it can be challenging to learn something new in astrology, you will find that there is an immense wealth of information about a relationship in a composite chart. Once you begin considering the composite chart alongside synastry in relationship readings, you’ll never go back!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MANIFEST-ISSUE-email-sig.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9mom6KZk2R%2BdIGScGtuZ6edrrV5yKxkmmWTpLqxu9Kiq55lk52us8CO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
