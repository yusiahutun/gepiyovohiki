They come in all shapes and sizes, from integrated modules to standalone devices. Like standard hi-fi amplifiers, most are solid-state but some use analog valves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/monolith_monoprice.jpg><p>There's a good chance that the device you're using to read this article has a headphone amplifier in it, whether it's a smartphone or a notebook. This type of amplifier is designed to drive the vast majority of headphones, which are known as low impedance headphones.</p><h2 id=why-might-you-need-a-headphone-amp>Why Might You Need a Headphone Amp</h2><p>If you're using headphones with a particular device and you find that the volume simply isn't loud enough, a headphone amplifier can be used to boost the signal and provide a <a href=#>higher output volume</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Hearing Loss: How Loud is Too Loud?</a></span></p><p>One reason your headphones might not be loud enough is that the integrated amplifier can't provide enough power to drive them. Most headphones are designed with an impedance of 50 ohms or less, which means they can be easily driven by most small devices like smartphones and notebooks. The higher the impedance, the more power the headphones will require.</p><p>The sensitivity of your headphones also plays a role, since this dictates how loud your headphones will be (measured in decibels, or dB) at a certain power level (measured in milliwatts, or mW). If you buy a pair of headphones you will see these ratings featured in the specifications, but since most headphones are low impedance and designed for use with everyday devices, you'd be forgiven for not paying too much attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sennheiser_athm50x.png><p>High impedance headphones are typically characterized by drivers that use thinner voice coils. Thinner coils are more difficult to manufacture since they use more layers of wire compared to low impedance models. This means less air in the windings of the coil and a stronger electromagnetic field.</p><p>Such headphones (like the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Sennheiser HD 660 S</a>) are "harder" to drive, which is where headphone amplifiers usually come in. The result is widely considered to sound better, with less distortion compared to lower impedance models. It's not necessarily a difference you're going to glean from reading a description on the web, so you're better off heading to a hi-fi retailer and having a listen to see for yourself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/41gtqngojjl-_sl500_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>SENNHEISER HD 660 S - HiRes Audiophile Open Back Headphone</h5><span>Sennheiser HD 600 S</span><p class=display-card-description>Reference-class open-back headphones from Sennheiser deliver audiophile performance when paired with a suitable headphone amplifier or hi-resolution audio player, with a nominal impedance of 150 ohms.</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Amazon</a><p>High-end electrostatic headphones (sometimes known as "earspeakers") require an amplifier specifically for that type of listening device. These headphones (like the <a href=#>Mitchell and Johnson MJ1</a> and similar <a href=#>Stax</a> models) don't use moving parts like common models which rely on an electrodynamic coil but rather an ultralight film. They're widely considered the most natural and accurate headphones you can buy, but they don't come cheap (particularly when you factor in the price of a good amp).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/stax_sr-009s.jpg><p>In other words, if your headphones sound plenty loud enough and you aren't using fancy in-ear monitors or over-ear headphones, you probably don't need a headphone amplifier.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're finding that your headphones are too quiet, you'll have to match their sensitivity (measured in decibels) and impedance (measured in ohms) with a suitable headphone amplifier.</p><h2 id=different-types-of-headphone-amplifier>Different Types of Headphone Amplifier</h2><p>The most common type of headphone amplifier is Integrated into most mobile devices, including MP3 players, smartphones, and notebooks. These are designed to drive the most common types of headphones with an impedance of fewer than 50 ohms. Most models of headphones get plenty loud enough under these conditions.</p><p>Some devices, like Apple's <a href=#>2021 16-inch and 14-inch MacBook Pros</a> and some high-resolution portable audio players can drive headphones with higher impedance, but this is the exception rather than the rule.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/macbook_3.5mm.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are also portable headphone amplifiers that are powered by batteries and designed to provide a higher volume output on the go. They may be useful in driving headphones with higher impedance, but they require additional space and battery power which may be inconvenient. One example is the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">FiiO A3</a> which is suitable for driving headphones with an impedance of up to 150 ohms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/41zwlbyx5tl-_sl500_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>FiiO A3 Portable Headphone Amplifier (Black)</h5><span>Portable Headphone Amplifier</span><p class=display-card-description>Drive headphones with up to 150 ohms impedance at a suitable volume on the go with the rechargeable FiiO A3.</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Amazon</a><p>Many headphone amps also act as <a href=#>external digital-to-analog converters</a> (DACs) in addition to boosting the signal.
