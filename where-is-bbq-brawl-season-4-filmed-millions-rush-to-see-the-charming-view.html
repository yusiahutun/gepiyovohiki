The ten episodes were shot in&nbsp;Northern California&nbsp;with chefs&nbsp;Bobby Flay, Anne Burrell, and&nbsp;Sunny Anderson&nbsp;as coaches, while the contestants are from all over the USA.</p><p>Half Moon Bay is home to the Santa Maria-style BBQ and is on the coast, about 35 minutes south of San Francisco.&nbsp;Several fans noticed that, during the first episode, the Californian beach was mentioned.</p><p>Santa Maria barbecues were developed along the Golden State’s coast. The Santa Maria grill is open-air with no cover and made with large iron grates whose distance from the fire can be adjusted with a crank.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-half-moon-bay-location-and-sports>Half Moon Bay: Location and sports</h2><p>Half Moon Bay is known for its surfing community and is home to a very popular pumpkin festival in October. The small city includes a string of beaches along the bay, such as Half Moon Bay State Beach.</p><p>It is popular for&nbsp;Mavericks, a big-wave surf location, and is called Half Moon Bay because of its crescent shape. The place was founded in the 1840s as&nbsp;San Benito,&nbsp;and then as its fishing community grew, it was renamed&nbsp;Spanishtown.</p><p>In 1874, it was again renamed Half Moon Bay. After rail and road connections in the early 1900s, the town grew.&nbsp;The foggy weather of the coast made the town a popular destination for booze-running during&nbsp;Prohibition.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bbq-brawl-left-its-original-location>BBQ Brawl left its original location</h2><p>The show was originally filmed in Austin, Texas, for seasons 1 to 3 but switched the location up for season 4. Star Hill Ranch is specifically where camera crews set up their shots for the first three seasons.</p><p>Producers moved the show location to put a spotlight on a regional style of barbecuing. Alongside Half Moon Bay, the contestants also got busy in Long Branch Saloon, just a few miles out of town in the main location.</p><p>Its new location at Half Moon Bay has 4 million visitors. In 2019 alone, 3.72 million Americans took part in surfing activities across the world, and the global surf industry was valued at over $10 billion that same year.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by bobby flay (@bobbyflay)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH BBQ BRAWL ON FOOD NETWORK EVERY MONDAY AT 9/8C</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfmLywt8innmarmKTEtHvWoZyrnV2ewG6uwapkm6qRrLluv8SaqqimXWl6p7XLppydZZ2eua21zqeqZqqlqLVuwM5mqp6dXam1pnnCoZirpZmjtG7CyJ6u</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
