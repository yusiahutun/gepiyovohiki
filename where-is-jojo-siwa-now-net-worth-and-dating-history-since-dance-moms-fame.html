Nebraska</p><p><strong>Relationship status</strong>: Single</p><p><strong>Birthday</strong>: May 19, 2003</p><p>Born to Jessalynn and Tom Siwa in 2003, JoJo is a dancer, singer, actress, and <a href=#>YouTuber</a> from Nebraska. The 20-year-old was destined for a career in dance as her mother is a professional dance instructor from Iowa. Tom, meanwhile, is a chiropractor.</p><p>Her older brother, Jayden Siwa, became a social <a href=#>influencer</a> in his own right after his sister appeared on TV.</p><p>JoJo entered the public eye at eight years old as the youngest contestant in season 2 of Abby Lee’s Ultimate Dance Competition season 2. A jazz and hip-hop dancer, she made it to the top 5 and eventually secured a spot on season 5 of Dance Moms after joining the Abby Lee Dance Company.</p><p>She became a Dance Moms favorite but her stint lasted for only two seasons; she left to join Nickelodeon. To date, JoJo has appeared in 12 Nickelodeon productions, including as a host of Lip Sync Battle Shorties with Nick Cannon.</p><p>In recent years, Siwa has been cast as a celebrity personality rather than as an actress. Her most notable projects include Dancing With The Stars season 30, where she placed second with Jenna Johnson as the first same-sex couple, and as a judge on RuPaul’s Drag Race: All-Stars.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>JoJo switched her YouTube channel to XOMG Pop</h2><p>JoJo grew her fanbase as a vlogger on YouTube but starting from at least January 2023, the channel, ItsJoJoSiwa, is no longer accessible. It directs fans to XOMG Pop!’s profile, the account of the music group she founded.</p><p>The colorful girl group made their <a href=#>TV</a> debut on America’s Got Talent in 2022.</p><p>JoJo herself has music experience; she released her first single, Boomerang, in 2015 and the video has been viewed over 977 million times.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>JoJo Siwa’s net worth skyrocketed thanks to her signature style</h2><p>Glittery hair accessories, especially oversized hair bows, became Siwa’s trademark look ever since her Dance Moms debut. From bejeweled pink ribbons to sparkly yellow patterns, you wouldn’t see the teen without a bow on her head.</p><p>She seized the opportunity for brand collaborations with Claires and JC Penney to release her own collection of bows. “JoJo Bows” were so successful that they became a UK tween craze and were eventually banned at some schools since they were “distracting” and didn’t comply with uniform codes. Students also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reportedly</a> experienced bullying due to the competitiveness to own a real JoJo Bow.</p><p>Combining the commercial success of her hair accessories with her TV appearances, JoJo has a net worth of $20 million – and she’s only 20.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>JoJo came out as gay in 2021</h2><p>In January 2021, Siwa hinted at her sexual preference in a <a href=#>TikTok</a> video dancing to Lady Gaga’s Born This Way, the 2011 hit regarded as an LGBTQ anthem.</p><p>Days later, the then-17-year-old posted a more definitive message on Twitter: a photo of herself wearing a t-shirt reading “Best. Gay. Cousin. Ever” – a gift from her cousin.</p><p>On Friday, Siwa posted a more definitive message, sharing a photo of herself wearing a shirt that reads “Best. Gay. Cousin. Ever.” and saying her cousin got it for her.</p><p>If you’re wondering how she discovered her sexual identity, JoJo claims she was a massive fan of Demi Lovato’s song, Cool For The Summer, a <a href=#>music</a> track about a summer fling with a woman. Siwa admitted that she was too young to understand the track’s message at the time.</p><p>Another occasion was her obsession with Jenna Dewan’s Lip Sync Battle performance which saw the actress dance provocatively as Magic Mike.</p><p>The final “awakening” was when her first date, a male, wanted to be physically intimate but JoJo admitted she was “grossed out” by the thought.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>JoJo Siwa’s dating life and girlfriends so far</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Mark Bontempo</h3><p>Months before coming out, JoJo dated TikTok star Mark Bontempo for about three months from August to November 2021. They announced their relationship in Siwa’s TikTok video posted on National Girlfriend Day.</p><p>On Mark’s account, the pair duetted a clip of JoJo admitting in a “put a finger down” video that she is not “currently single.” The TikTok video quickly panned to Siwa as they both cheekily smiled before the video cut off.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Kylie Prew</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/06/GettyImages-1400930459-708x1024.jpg><p>The reality star’s first public girlfriend was her best friend Kylie Prew, who she called as “the most loving, supportive, happiest, protective, and just the most beautiful perfect person in the world.”</p><p>The couple dated for nine months before splitting in October 2021 citing “wrong time” as a contributing factor for their break-up.</p><p>“Right person, wrong time,” Siwa said. “We’re both so young, she’s 17, I’m 18, and we are literally best friends.”</p><p>The teens reunited in 2022 but called it quits again by August.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Avery Cyrus</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/06/GettyImages-1244947234-707x1024.jpg><p>Siwa’s most recent partner was TikTok and YouTube creator Avery Cyrus. Although her last name is Cyrus, she is not related to Miley Cyrus. Her real surname is Blanchard.</p><p>Cyrus and Siwa made their relationship official with a TikTok video that showed the two kissing in a photo booth. Days later, the couple made their red carpet debut.</p><p>The pair dated for three months until December 2022.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmluX2h9cMPHnqmeZZmoequ7yahkrKGnlnqvu9ZmpZ6sXay8s8DHZpinnF2ZrrW1zaBkoaGjqbyzxYysoKeblWKxorrCnmSmp52oeqetzJ5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
