Michael Strahan returned to Good Morning America on November 15, 2023, after a two-week absence. “Can I just say we have tears of joy because Michael is back here at the desk,” host Robin Roberts said at the beginning of the show. &nbsp;Strahan replied, “It is great to back with both of you.” However, the explanation of his absence has not been explained.</p><p>A Good Morning America spokesperson released a statement to multiple publications like <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/11/07/michael-strahan-good-morning-america-absence-explained/71485979007/>USA Today</a> and People about Strahan’s absence. “Michael Strahan will not be with us this week as he is dealing with some personal family matters,” the spokesperson says. “We appreciate everyone’s thoughts and concerns.”</p><p>Since his absence, Nightline co-anchor Juju Chang and World News Tonight host Linsey Davis have filled in for Strahan. Fox Sports analyst Curt Menefee noted over the weekend that Strahan would be out because he was dealing with a personal matter.</p><p>Strahan is a father to four. He shares his two older kids, Tanita, 31, and Michael Jr., 28, with his first wife Wanda Hutchins,&nbsp;and 19-year-old twins Isabella and Sophia with his second wife,&nbsp;Jean Muggli. “My kids give me strength,” he told <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://people.com/tv/michael-strahan-meet-the-good-morning-america-stars-blended-family/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2016. “I love being with the kids. To me it’s all about family, now more than anything.”</p><p>He also regarded his kids as a reminder to have fun in life. “Sometimes life gets serious for us as adults, but looking at my kids, it lets me know that you’re allowed to have fun — you’re allowed to have mindless fun,” he said. “And you’re allowed to be yourself and act like no one is watching. I think that is the most valuable lesson that I’ve learned from them. They keep on teaching me every day, so I’m always willing to learn.”</p><p>In an interview with The New York Post just weeks before his absence, he also said he wanted to be a beacon of hope for his adult kids. “I want to be an example for my kids and family. I also think I’m driven by the fact that I have a lot of people who I work with who I know depend on me, and I never want to disappoint them. And also doing things that people don’t think that I should be able to do. Almost like proving people wrong, which has kind of been, I guess, the driving force of my life.”</p><p>He also talked about his first entrance to <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://nypost.com/2023/10/11/michael-strahan-on-football-fashion-and-embracing-fear/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Good Morning America</a> in 2016. “I just wanted to fit in to make sure I wasn’t a weak link, and then I could add to the show. I’m a normal guy doing an abnormal job sometimes, I feel. People want to see the news from a lot of different angles.” He continued, “I think the common thread for me on TV is that I’m not afraid to be myself. Because the world is imperfect, and if you make a mistake, you just correct it and move on and half the time people don’t even notice.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfrLWmvsRmpKKbmJayrXnSramaoJGjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
