Decades of advocacy and fundraising culminated in the 2012 opening of the Olivia Newton-John Wellness and Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia.</p><p id=eDrPJeopwyy8 data-wc=82>"To have a place that supports the people that are going through it and their families is my dream,"&nbsp;she said of the Centre, which is now involved in about 200 clinical trials for a variety of cancers. She also established the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund, an independent charity sponsoring global research into plant medicine for cancer.

Ronnie was just 16 when she and the Ronettes recorded "Be My Baby" in 1963, cementing her as one of the most important and revolutionary voices, male or female, in early rock 'n'&nbsp;roll. Subsequent hits, with Ronnie’s enormous voice at the center, included "Walking in the Rain"&nbsp;and "Baby I Love You."</p><p id=euJueaV95EkC data-wc=60>Born and raised in East Harlem, Ronnie (born Veronica Bennett) was of mixed racial heritage, and brought a unique blend of edge, sexuality, and power to her performances and styling.
