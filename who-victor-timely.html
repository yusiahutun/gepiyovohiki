Victor Timely is a variant of Kang The Conqueror. He’s actually introduced in in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania when Loki and Mobius go to one of his talks in the post-credit scene.</p><p>According to Loki producer Kevin Wright, Victor Timely is a crucial part of this season’s plot. “Timely becomes a really big part of the team, and we’re super excited because we had a very specific Victor Timely story that we wanted to tell this season,” he told<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.ign.com/articles/loki-season-2-producer-on-ke-huy-quan-jonathan-majors-victor-timely-and-that-mcdonalds-subplot rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> IGN. </a>“I’ve been trying to get him in there since Season 1, and there’s only so much story you could tell. So I’m really excited, because I think he becomes a big part of that. Yeah, I don’t want to say too much without spoiling, but it’s unexpected. I think when you come with the warning that war is coming, you’re expecting a sci-fi villain from the future. The fun of Timely is that he is a very introverted, slightly eccentric inventor from the past, which is going to cause a lot of conflict amongst our characters because he may not be what they were expecting.”</p><p>Wright expanded on the character in an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://screenrant.com/loki-season-2-ep-victor-timely-conflict-loki-sylvie-tva/>Screen Rant</a>. “I think in what we were trying to do at the end of season one was to get everybody obviously terrified of, ‘War is coming. This is going to be scary.’ You see the scary character in Ant-Man and just the idea that the sci-fi villain is not coming from the future, but maybe is this unassuming, slightly eccentric inventor from the past was fun. It allows us to go to exciting places.”</p><p>He continued, “But really, what was exciting about it from a character standpoint is he is kind of the perfect person to fuel the character conflict between Loki, Sylvie, and the TVA of, ‘You’re saying something scary is coming. You are saying that you want everybody to have free will, but you’re also swearing that you’re going to kill the next variant of him to pop up.’ It creates almost a contradiction or a paradox of, if you truly believe in free will, you’ve got to believe that man’s words when he says, ‘I’m my own person. I can make my own choices. I’m not the man you think I am.’ And I think it was just for somebody like Jonathan, it just fuels what he does best, which is creating really deep and complex characters.”</p><p>In the comics, Victor Timely “founds the town of Timely, Wisconsin. As its first Mayor and a leader in industry, he transforms the city into a technological marvel. Though his true self acts behind closed doors and lays the foundation for future conquests.” He’s revealed to be Kang Prime and is a time traveler throughout the universe. He also has superhuman strength and can age slower than most.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfrLWwedWimq2nomLBqrnEpbBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
