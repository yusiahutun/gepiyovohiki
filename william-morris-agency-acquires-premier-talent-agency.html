"We look forward to working closely with Barbara, Frank and<br>their distinguished clients."</p><p>"We're excited to bring our talented clients into the bigger<br>family<br>of William Morris," said Skydel, "which as the oldest and largest talent agency in the<br>world<br>has the reach and influence to continue the style and quality of<br>representation<br>that we've provided for so many years at Premier."</p><p>Barsalona added: "I view this acquisition as one legend joining another, and<br>I'm<br>excited about the lasting legacy of Premier Talent as it becomes a<br>contributing<br>part of William Morris."</p><p>Skydel became executive vice president of Premier in 1977 and partner<br>alongside<br>Barsalona in 1985, becoming the first female principal of a major talent<br>agency.<br>During her 30-year career, Skydel has been named Performance Magazine's<br>Agent of<br>the Year five times and Billboard's Agent of the Year twice. In 2000, she<br>was<br>saluted by "Women In Music" with the Touchstone Award, which recognizes<br>women in<br>the industry who have made a difference.</p><p>Barsalona founded Premier Talent in 1964 after serving as the youngest agent<br>at<br>General Artists Corporation, where he booked the initial Beatles and Rolling<br>Stones appearances in the United States. As the first contemporary music<br>agency<br>in the U.S., Barsalona intended for Premier to answer the growing need for<br>change in the market while addressing his unique philosophy as a performer.</p><p>Billboard published a special tribute to Premier in honor of the<br>agency's<br>20th anniversary, and Barsalona has received the Performance Touring Hall of<br>Fame<br>Award. He is also a founding member and serves on the board of the Rock and<br>Roll<br>Hall of Fame, and on March 11, he will be honored with the Silver Clef Award<br>from the Nordoff-Robbins Foundation.</p><p>Premier's clients include, among others, Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers,<br>Roger<br>Waters, The Pretenders, Sinead O'Connor, The Who, Pete Townshend, Keith<br>Richards, Bob Geldof, Marianne Faithfull, Suzanne Vega, Sebastian Bach,<br>Greg<br>Lake,</p><p>Big Audio Dynamite,<br>Butterfly Jones,<br>Desmond Child,</p><p>Harvey Fierstein,<br>Bob Geldof,<br>Roger Hodgson,<br>The Hooters,<br>Little Steven,</p><p>Linda Perry,</p><p>Art On Ice,<br>Havana Night and<br>James Last Orchestra.</p><p>Bruce Springsteen was no longer a client of Premier at the time of the WMA acquisition, which has been rumored for months. Springsteen's long-time agent Barry Bell left Premier last summer, as exclusively reported on Celebrity Access, and took the Boss with him. U2 has not been with Premier for a few tours now once Michael Cohl started booking the group internationally.</p><p>Inside sources say that Jane Geraghty, the only other agent that was left at Premier, is taking some much-needed time off and evaluating her options.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGivmaG5qq3MZqSoqqKewG6txp6lnLFdlrCywcirnKxloKeyrrXEq2StmZyau7V5wKCcp5upZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
