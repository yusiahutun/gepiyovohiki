Her father, Zhu Songchun, and mother, Cui Jie, immigrated to the US for work. She has one sister, Stephanie.</p>Zhu’s father, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">a renowned artificial intelligence expert</span></a>, graced his daughter with a “simple” two-character name in a tribute to classic Chinese divination book Yi Jing – also known as the Book of Changes.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/10/96ced6e5-6cd8-4dce-be65-a5ef4d7861bb_0a313aad.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We wanted her to make a difference in whatever she does,” he told China Central Television, adding he hoped her name would “not be forgotten”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhu pulled on her first skates aged seven after joining classes with a family friend. It did not long to “get the hang of it”, as junior regional coaches quickly took notice.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her mother would take Zhu to the historic Los Angeles Figure Skating Club almost every day for more than six years. She eventually gave up her full-time job to guide her daughter’s fledgling junior career.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Though missing out on consecutive US junior nationals, Zhu won her first notable title at the US junior novice championships in 2018.</p>The same year, Zhu switched allegiances to become one of several overseas recruits China made ahead of Beijing 2022. She was examined by trailblazer Chen Lu – a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">former world champion</span></a> and double-Olympic medallist who won her country’s first medal in figure skating.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In one of her first Chinese representative team outings, Zhu came fourth at the national championships in Harbin in 2019. Two months later, she was third at the Sofia Trophy, and 11th at a China Grand Prix event.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/02/08/thumbnail.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:10</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Tears and online criticism as China’s US-born skater Zhu Yi falters in another Olympic routine</p><p>Tears and online criticism as China’s US-born skater Zhu Yi falters in another Olympic routine</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A 13th place outing at the distinguished Four Continents Championship in 2020 certainly helped with confidence, before Zhu came 22nd at the junior worlds.</p>Pre-Olympics, Zhu finished seventh at the Asia Open Trophy, a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Beijing Games test event</span></a>, and set her personal bests – combined total 171.25, short programme 60.00 and free skate 111.25 – at the 2021 Gran Premio d’Italia last November.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Coached by Chinese Olympian Li Wei, Zhu has been skating this season to The Rolling Stones’ Paint it Black in the short programme, and Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Sunset Boulevard in the free skate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then came the first wave of controversy. Zhu’s Olympic selection was met intense criticism from local figure skating fans, who were adamant stars such as 2020 Cup of China winner Chen Hongyi, and former US national junior bronze medallist Ashley Lin Shan would be better suited. Texas-born Lin chose to represent China in 2019.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m upset and a little embarrassed,” Zhu said afterwards, tears running down her face. “I guess I felt a lot of pressure because I know everyone in China was surprised with the selection … I just really wanted to show what I was able to do, but unfortunately, I didn’t.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A day later, Zhu fell to last place in the free skate, where China finished fifth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/02/08/thumbnail.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">‘There is a lot of room for her to improve’</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sacrificing ballet, piano-playing and art, Zhu was serious about her figure skating career from early on.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I like to laugh, have fun, and be silly with friends and stuff,” she told CCTV two years ago. “But on the ice, I focus on what I’m doing.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m excited to have the opportunity to skate for China, and to become another big name. To make myself and the audience happy when I’m skating.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/10/d7cf9fcb-214d-43bf-aef3-f21dd665df08_cfae56b0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhu had been learning under three-time Olympian Ivan Dinev for much of her US-based training. The 11-time Bulgarian national champion gave insight into her national representative dilemma.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The opportunity to represent China is big,” he said soon after she made her choice. “But I feel like it was a very hard decision, because at that moment she was top in her novice level. She had won the nationals and was very close to becoming Team USA.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That was the moment when she [had to decide] where to go. ‘What can China offer? What can the US offer?’ I think it wasn’t an easy decision, but she made the right one.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was not as if Zhu could waltz into the legendary Chen’s singles team, either. She was thoroughly scrutinised in training by then-women’s head coach Chen, before acknowledging her “good potential”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“She completed three weeks with high quality. Of course, a star skater requires artistic expression and maturity. There is a lot of room for her to improve,” Chen told Beijing News.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/10/9380fea4-bda3-4d22-bb8f-0c454e1a5524_5bfa8d2c.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">‘Should I continue or not?’</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">National affiliations aside, Zhu’s figure skating trajectory took a turn after a training injury in 2018. She required stitches in her foot, but it was the mental stress that plagued her most.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was a silly end-of-the-day jump, and she stepped on her foot and [the blade] went through the tongue [of her skates] and all the way into two bones,” Dinev told CCTV.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It took forever to heal and it was a big challenge for her. Almost to the point of ‘should I continue or not?’. But she had lots of help from family and coaching staff.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhu added: “When I stabbed my foot, it was really hard for me to come back and train to be where I am now. I was scared to jump after, and kept thinking there was stuff wrong. It affected everything.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I got back, my coaches put me on the positional harness and got me rotating again, and my friends and family kept telling me I’d get through it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A week before her Olympics outing, Zhu shared her goals on Instagram: “So so so honoured to be representing team China at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. After five test skates, I’m proud to have fought till the very end to achieve such a big dream of mine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Especially after having a couple of rough years, I’m so grateful for those who helped me push past the negative thoughts and injuries; helping me grow throughout this journey. Hoping to show everyone how hard I’ve worked and put the best version of myself out there on the ice!”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">‘She steals people’s dreams’</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One catalyst in the “Shame on Zhu Yi” saga is her father’s work. Zhu Songchun is a renowned AI expert who switched his position at the University of California, Los Angeles to lead Peking University’s Institute for General Artificial Intelligence in 2020.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Professor Zhu would work with both the central government and Beijing to set-up new academic institutes for collaboration, the University said at the time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Hubei native, Zhu attained his PhD from Harvard University and is considered to be at the forefront of “computer vision”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Netizens have – without evidence – linked the Hubei native’s high-level ties with Zhu receiving a coveted Beijing Olympics spot. “She steals people’s dreams and positions,” one troll wrote, before the 200 million views-strong hashtag was seemingly censored.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/10/24856ec2-e031-4a54-a23f-d65fa22f1578_509c811a.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">‘Like a family’</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Several Chinese teammates rushed to Zhu’s defence following the online vitriol.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“She faced immense pressure, and it was her first time at the Olympics, held in Beijing, her home country. I hope she can adjust. We will all consoler her and hope she can perform her best next time.”</p>Reigning Asian Winter Games gold medallist ice dancer, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Wang Shiyue</span></a>, was seen embracing a struggling Zhu as she waited for her score rinkside.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/10/a13545ce-8ba1-4866-99cf-19e92243fdef_3eeef851.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s like a family to compete here in Beijing together with my team. I’m so grateful to have them,” Zhu said. “Without my teammates, I don’t even know whether I can make it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fresh gold medallist Eileen Gu told reporters after her win that Zhu was “already amazing” to have made it to the Games, and that “mistakes and pressure are both part of the sport”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She later commented on an Instagram post by Insider, detailing how Zhu “gave up her US citizenship to compete for China – now, she’s being attacked by Chinese social media users after falling in her Olympic debut”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/10/ebcdd9e6-ff4e-4938-8243-b09a9f0496a6_eee502fe.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As someone who actually uses Chinese social platforms, I’m going to say right here that over 90 per cent of comments are positive and uplifting. It’s part of the sport and everyone understands [that],” Gu wrote.</p>Though she likely wants to see the back of the Games sooner rather than later, Zhu still has the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">women’s singles short programme</span></a> event on February 15, and the finals two days later if she ranks high enough.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mnKCZo65wrdGtoJyklWSAcoKVbmxxZ6eeu7Wx0WampbGdpbakv4ywn6hlqp3CbsXIZqysZZKkv695wqGgp52jmnqntcauqZ5lo6CutbHRZq6hp6OaeqOxyKOgp58%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
