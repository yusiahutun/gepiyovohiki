We were both very religious," the 56-year-old actor explained. "It was a Presbyterian college at the time and I was there on a Presbyterian scholarship and he was involved in the church activities."</p><p>"You were so good at being Presbyterian they drafted you?" joked Kimmel, to which Harrelson responded, "I was actually considering being a minister and then I just kind of went a different way."</p><p>When asked if he had any memories of "a young Mike Pence," Harrelson said he "actually quite liked him." That being said, don't count on any college reunion between the two anytime soon.</p><p>"I thought he was a very good guy. He was very religious, very committed. So seeing in how I'm not quite in that ballpark now, I don't know how we'd get along because I think he's still quite religious, just a whole different brand of religious," he continued.
