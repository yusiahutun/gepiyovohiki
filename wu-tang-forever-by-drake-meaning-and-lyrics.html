At first glance, the lyrics appear to revolve around love and possessiveness. However, employing the Straussian analysis method, we can uncover unexpected comparisons to the popular TV show "Game of Thrones" that bring an entirely new dimension to the song's meaning.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>The hook of the song establishes Drake's longing for a deep connection with an individual, asserting that their relationship is special and exclusive. He addresses the listener, emphasizing that they belong together and that their bond is irreplaceable. Additionally, the lyrics highlight Drake's transition from a former friend to a lover, as he brings the intensity and passion expressed by the rap group Wu-Tang Clan. Ultimately, the artist presents this newfound love interest as something undeniable and unequivocally his.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty=true style=white-space:pre-wrap></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>To unravel the hidden layers within "Wu-Tang Forever," it is interesting to draw parallels between the song and the unique dynamics found in the world of "Game of Thrones." Within this context, the protagonist, Drake, could represent Jon Snow, a character characterized by his ability to bring diverse factions together and unite them under one banner.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>The Wu-Tang Clan, in turn, can be likened to the various noble houses vying for power in Westeros. Just as the Wu-Tang Clan gained fame by introducing a new style, Drake is portrayed as revolutionizing the rap game with his distinctive approach. His ability to switch up the game and appeal to a broad audience correlates with Jon Snow's successful unification of diverse groups towards a common goal.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>The reference to "open cases on me for a half a million each" reflects Jon Snow's constant struggles and challenges as he faces relentless opposition from enemies within and beyond the Wall. However, despite the difficulties, both Drake and Jon Snow find solace in the fact that their respective journeys are incomparable and paved with their own unique paths. The mention of "peace knowing that it's harder in the streets" alludes to the tumultuous nature of the world they inhabit, where true solace is found not through external factors but within oneself.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>The line "People like Mazin who was a best friend to me" unveils Drake's vulnerability and showcases his ability to adapt. This line can be interpreted as referencing the shifting alliances and loyalties among characters on "Game of Thrones," where best friends turn into distant memories due to the ever-changing nature of power dynamics. Drake assimilates this idea into the broader theme of personal growth, suggesting that it is essential to adapt to change to maintain integrity in one's journey.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Alternative Interpretations:</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Moreover, within the framework of Straussian analysis, it is crucial to consider alternative interpretations that other characters within the song might hold. One such perspective could be embodied by the character Cersei Lannister from "Game of Thrones." Cersei, a cunning and manipulative woman, epitomizes the idea that power corrupts, and holding onto power becomes an obsession. In this context, Drake's possessiveness and assertion that "this sh_t belong[s] to nobody" could mirror Cersei's desperate grasping onto control and dominance.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Cultural Influences:</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>It is also worth exploring unexpected cultural influences that may have inspired Drake's lyrics. For example, the Wu-Tang Clan's gritty and uncompromising style resonates with the narrative of "Peaky Blinders." This popular British TV show, set in post-World War I England, examines the Shelby crime family's rise to power and their unwavering hold on their neighborhood. The ruthlessness displayed by the Peaky Blinders aligns with the Wu-Tang Clan's reputation and the assertiveness of Drake's lyrics.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Through Straussian analysis, Drake's "Wu-Tang Forever" transcends its surface-level meaning and offers a multifaceted depiction of relationships, power dynamics, and personal growth. By connecting the song to the intricacies of "Game of Thrones" and cultural references like "Peaky Blinders," we can appreciate the depth of Drake's artistry and storytelling. Ultimately, "Wu-Tang Forever" serves as both a testament to Drake's impact on the music industry and a reflection on the complex nature of the human experience.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonylvsCknGivpWLBorrGZp2oqpWrsrN5wbJknaqRoLJuucSapaKml2Kur7CMpbCroZOo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
