The event will take place July 14-16, with Hank Williams Jr., Zach Bryan and Caamp headlining.</p><p>In September, Grimes will travel to the Park at Harlinsdale Farm in Franklin, Tenn., for the Pilgrimage Festival. Zach Bryan&nbsp;is headlining, with performances from Ashley McBryde, Margo Price, Ian Munsick,&nbsp;the War and Treaty and more also on the bill. Grimes' labelmate Hailey Whitters is also on the lineup.</p><p>Shortly after signing with Mercury Nashville/Range Music in 2022, Grimes released his debut single "<a href=#>No Horse to Ride</a>"&nbsp;on Dec. 16. He co-wrote the song with Jonathan Singleton and Tony Lane and also played acoustic guitar and drums on the track.</p><p>"No Horse to Ride" is a song that explores what life would be like if the protagonist were to ever lose the love of his life. He draws several comparisons to illustrate those feelings of devastation.</p><p>"I'd be a drunk without a drink to drink / A guitar with a broken string / Without you, I'd be a fallin' star without a midnight sky / A cowboy with no horse to ride," he sings in the chorus.</p><p>Grimes will have to juggle his music career with his work on Yellowstone, which is currently in the middle of&nbsp;Season&nbsp;5. The second half of the installment has been delayed due to rumored contract complications with the show's star <a href=#>Kevin Costner</a>. As of now, the show is expected to return in the fall.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>2023 Country Music Festivals Guide</h2><p>Enjoy an updated list of country music's best festivals, across America, Canada, Great Britain and more.
