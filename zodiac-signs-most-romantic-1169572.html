If you’re familiar with Western astrology, you’ll know that the twelve members of the zodiac are divided up into four elements: earth, air, water, and fire."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This is the <a href=# id=auto-tag_zodiac-sign data-tag=zodiac-sign>zodiac sign</a> that’s ruled by Venus—planet of love and beauty—which means that Taurus is attracted to all the finer things in life (romance being one of them). If you’re dating a Taurus, they’ll shower you with gifts, snuggle you with constant comfort and they’ll even give you enough back massages to leave you feeling completely de-stressed. After all, no sign if more sensual than a Taurus.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LEO4.jpg><h2>Leo</h2><p>Is anyone surprised to see Leo on the list of most romantic zodiac signs? I certainly am not. Ruled by the sun, Leo loves nothing more than to shower someone they love with good energy and positive vibes. Whether they’re hyping you up or inspiring you to express yourself, a Leo will always encourage you to embrace your romantic side. If you’re dating one, you better prepare for grand displays of affection that make everyone jealous of your over-the-top love. Valentine’s Day is definitely no joke to a Leo!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LIBRA4.jpg><h2>Libra</h2><p>Let’s be real—Libras are embarrassingly romantic. They love nothing more than the process of courtship and falling in love with someone one date at a time. In fact, if they’re single for too long, they’ll start to feel antsy! When they’re in the dating game, they’re dominating the field, because no one understands the rules of the love game better than a Libra. Ruled by Venus, this zodiac sign is all about the sparks that fly when two people are incredibly into each other. Libras are natural flirts who always have a little black book, but when they’re into you, they’re *really* into you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PISCES4.jpg><h2>Pisces</h2><p>No zodiac sign is more obsessed with romance than a Pisces. After all, Pisces is literally the zodiac sign of fantasies and alternate realities, and isn’t the whole point of romance to make life feel more magical? If you’re dating a Pisces, you better be in for sweet love notes, extra long cuddle sessions and conversations about your feelings. Pisces isn’t afraid to drift away from the real world every now and when, and when a Pisces is in love with you, reality starts to feel so much more tolerable!</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter_july2020.jpg alt="StyleCaster newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZ6Yra2imny7u8OimJxlo560r7%2BMpqasrF2nvK6tza2gnGVhZoN6gZZrZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
